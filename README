 The following steps are necessary to do a full build of the IRIS 3.6 
 release:
	

 Requirements:
		
		Target drive = /TARGET: at least 200 Mbytes Free Space 
			      (110 Mbytes for objects and binaries)
			      (110 Mbytes for cpio image files)

		Bootable Image Build Drive = /BOOT:
			     3Mb partition of target drive (or any drive)
			     This drive must be a separate partition as it
			     is mkfs'ed.

			     (if this is not to be done then remove booti
			      from Makefile)

		Pascal and Fortan must both be install on your system

	NFS Builds:

		1) NFS Mount this directory ( /SOURCE) to the target machine
		2) cd /TARGET and do:
			
			tlink /SOURCE /TARGET

		   Then create a local copy of Makefile.DEMO that correctly
		   identifies each of the following: SRCROOT, TOOLROOT, ROOT
		   TROOT, DIST, and BOOT. Name this file Makefile. 

		        cd /TARGET
			make 


		This will build the whole 3.6 release and generate a build
		log in /TARGET/log called curlog. Examine the log for any
		build errors.
