2/4   cc not recognized as condition contol reg (only ccr recognized) -
	    	fixed and installed 2/4

2/6   .globl only recognized first symbol in list.  
		fixed and installed 2/6

2/12  as20 screwed up the data addresses if it had to split a zeroed 
		block on write.  Fixed and installed 2/12

3/13  in piped mode, with something else going on, as20 gets screwed up
		when trying to parse a stabs directive with a very long
		string.  It seems to get confused when the block ends
		suddenly.  (newc/error.c)

5/3   in piped mode, when a stab string spans more than one end-of-block, 
		problems occur.  Only one end-of-block was allowed before
		an error was reported.  Scan.c was changed to allow a
		line to take up the entire (0x2000 chars) input buffer
		before dying.

5/8   the following program causes problems:
		main:
			movl	#10$,d0
		foo:
		10$:	movl	#1,d1

	It is an error, as 10$ is not visible from line 2, but the
	assembler attempts to relocate it anyway, and gets the relocation
	info screwed up.  OUTSTANDING.

5/25  several problems found while documenting as20:
		did not allow relocatables as the single undefined in
		the expression of absolutes.  Fixed (about 2 hrs.) to
		do this and to allow dot.

		allowed relocatables but did NOT put out the relocation
		information for them.  OUTSTANDING.

		did not allow negate as the first symbol in the expression
		of direct assignments. OUTSTANDING.

		if condensation was necessary on the data segment, everything
		got screwed up.  FIXED.

		wouldn't work with multiple files, as scan() wasn't getting
		re-initialized correctly.  FIXED.

		.ascii was putting data into the code array, limiting it
		to about 30 bytes.  FIXED.

		jsr is never changed to the short form.  OUTSTANDING.

******** 1987 *************

5/15  memory-addressible single-bit rotates had size spec of long,
	when word was needed.  Added word versions.  Introduced
	x_umsg stuff to warn about outdated instruction mneumonics.
