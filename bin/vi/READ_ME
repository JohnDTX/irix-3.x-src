  This directory and its subdirectories contain the files necessary
for making ex/vi in the BTL UNIX environment: 

	This is a list of all the important directories and what's
	hidden under each.

	misc - contains files used in the "make" of ex/vi
	      { mkstr.c, xstr.c ...}
	
	vax - ex/vi source directory for the vax, 3B, C70, 370, &
	      pdp 11/70 (UNIX type=ov --  with overlays)

	pdp11  - ex/vi source directory for the pdp11/70 (UNIX type=od
	      without overlays)

	local - contains "uparm.h" which must be edited to
		reflect your system setup!
		EXAMPLE:
		--------
		#define libpath(file) "/usr/lib/file"
		#define loclibpath(file) "/usr/lib/file"
		#define binpath(file) "/usr/lbin/file"
		#define usrpath(file) "/usr/file"
		#define E_TERMCAP "/etc/termcap"
		#define B_CSH	"/bin/sh"
		** libpath is where ex/vi expects the strings file
		(ex2.15strings or ex3.7strings...this file is
		made as the ex/vi source is compiled), and
		ex/vi 's recover & preserve commands (ex2.15preserve
		or ex3.7preserve...and ex2.11recover or ex3.7recover).
		** usrpath is where the preserved files are held after
		a hangup or crash..."preserve" is tacked onto
		the end of the usrpath string .

	termcap.db - contains files to make/install termcap (the
		terminal database)

	termlib - contains files to make/install termlib.a
	(an archive used in the loading of the objects for ex/vi)
	note: termlib source includes the local/uparm.h file.

	lib - the old ms macro package is present for all the
	documents

	doc - contains all ex/vi documentation
	doc/man - man source pages for ex, vi, mkstr,
	fold, xstr, termcap, etc.

	Look through the source, make all necessary changes to
	local/uparm.h (& ex source if necessary) and then do
	a "makevi".  makevi is a shell which directs you through
	a "make" of ex/vi.

	PATHs to look at (and possibly change) include: 

	  vax/makefile.u3   ---|
	  pdp11/makefile.u3 ---|  the editor's string file,
	  preserve and recover commands all are installed in
	  ${DESTDIR}${LIBDIR}....make sure this is where you
	  want them to go.  This path must be the same as
	  the path defined in local/uparm.h ...c variable
	  name is usrpath.

	    termlib/makefile ---|  the path "/usr/lib/libtermlib.a"
	  (also known as libtermcap.a) is defined here. 

	     In the event of a hangup, the editor will place a
	  copy of the temporary file in the place  defined
	  ${DESTDIR}/usr/preserve.  The editor will be installed
	  in ${HOME1}.

Afternote:
		The 70 and vax code has been working for over a 
	week on th HOCC machines.  Let me know if any problems arise.
	Also, please forward any new and wonderful termcap descriptions.
