Changes to memtest for inclusion in bpcd

    1.	Added typedef "long jmp_buf[16]" to mem.h to avoid depending
	on setjmp.h.

    2.	Added character argument to memtest so that it sets its global
	"verbose" itself.  Avoids exporting any globals to bpcd.

    3.	Changed end and edata to _end and _edata in memtest.c

    4.	Attempted to have memtest return the number of errors encountered.
	There are 3 return statements in memtest.  Two looked like initial
	error conditions, so I had them return 1.  The third is at the
	end, so I had it return memterrs.  I'm not at all sure that these
	changes really do the job.
