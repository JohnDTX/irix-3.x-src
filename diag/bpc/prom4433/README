bpcd proms for an IP2 system

I assume that you want to make a prom board that can be "prom booted"
by an IP2 system.  Here's the procedure:

    1.	The PROM board should set to respond to address 200000
	(set S1 to 2, J1 to 0, and S2 to 0).

    2.	Use the latest copy of bpcd4433.r.  The bpcd4433.r file in
	this directory is linked to the file of the same name in
	the diag/bpc directory.  No need to copy!

    3.	Split the .r file into 64K chunks by typing

		~kurt/bin/psplit 0 10000 bpcd4433

	This will produce four output files: bpcd4433.0, bpcd4433.1,
	bpcd4433.2, and bpcd4433.3.

    4.	Use the GangPak in the data i/o programmer.  Initialize
	the programmer by keying in

		SELECT
		F
		9
		START

		SELECT
		F
		1
		START
		START

    5.	Install 4 128K EPROMs in the 4 upper locations of the
	GangPak.  Label these PROMs 1 0 3 2 from left to right.

    6.	Burn the first 4 EPROMs by typing

		nprom -S2 -v -cxxxx < bpcd4433.0

	This has been tested only with tony's personal version of
	nprom:	/og3/roaque/iris/gl2/proms/nprom.  The -cxxxx refers
	to the family pinout code for the data io.  See the wall chart
	for the correct code for the EPROMs that you are using
	(example hitachi -c7951).

    7.	Burn the second 4 EPROMs by typing

		nprom -S2 -v -cxxxx < bpcd4433.1

	label these EPROMs 5 4 7 6 from left to right.

    8.	Same procedure for EPROMs 8 through 11 and EPROMs 12 through 15.

    9.	Install the EPROMs in the board like this:

		0   2   4   6   8   10  12  14
		1   3   5   7   9   11  13  15

   10.	Install the PROM board in a system and type

		rom:

	to the monitor to get things rolling.  Be sure that the
	processor and the PROM board share the P2 extended address
	lines (P2 lines 55, 56, 57, and 58).
