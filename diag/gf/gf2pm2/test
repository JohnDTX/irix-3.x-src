I added your fifo tests to test/gf2pm2.
The sequence to use is:
	S   ft<n>   c#    ft<n>    c#   ......
where <n> is the test pattern number:
	0  floating 1, floating 0, other misc. data
	1  all 0's
	2  all 1's
	3  checker
	4  other checker

Eventually I will make it a little more convenient to run.
