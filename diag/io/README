The tests in this directory are for the purpose of testing the functionality
of the IO subsystem at a gross level.  They will generate appropriate errors
where necessary that will indicate the existence of a problem, should there
be any and should be used to direct a user to the appropriate problem area.

All of the commands make full use of the driver for the specified device
and will report error conditions when appropriate.

No Makefile is necessary for these commands, as they run under /bin/csh.
