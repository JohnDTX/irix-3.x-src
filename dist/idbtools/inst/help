** Software Installation Tool

The following words are specially recognized as answers to any of the
questions the software installation tool will ask:

	help		displays a message on how to answer the question
	verbose		(default) display file names as they are installed
	terse		don't display file names as they are installed
	sh		spawn a UNIX shell
	quit		terminates the installation

@ _type

There are two types of installation.  A "build" assumes that the disk
is being initially built up; that is, before the installation started,
the disk was (or was considered to be) empty of user-generated files
and other useful data.  When a build is begun, new file systems must be
made.  (Once the new, empty file systems are made, they need not be
remade until all new software is installed, even if the installation is
interrupted and restarted for some reason.)

An "update" assumes that there are user-generated files on the disk,
and/or user-altered system configuration files (/etc/passwd,
/etc/sys_id, /etc/hosts, and so on.)  The existing file systems will be
left as-is; previously installed software will be removed, except for
configuration files, and user-generated files will be retained.  This
is the typical case.

@ _mkfs

The root and user disk partitions must have file systems made on them
before software can be loaded on them to be used under UNIX.  If the
disk has already been in use, it will more than likely already have
file systems on it.  Otherwise, file systems will have to be made.
Making file systems destroys any data that may already be on the disk.
You should make new file systems when you are starting a "build"; if
you are continuing a previosly-started build, or are doing an update,
you should not make file systems.  You can answer this question "y" to
make new file systems, and "n" to leave the existing file systems as
is.

@ _more

Answer "y" if there is more software to be installed; e.g. if there is
more standard system software to be installed, or if there are options
to be installed.  If all software has been installed, answer "n".

@ _proceed

Answer "n" if you want to review the software product, image, and
subsystem selections again.  Answer "y" if you are satisfied with them
and want to proceed with the installation.  You can type "quit" to
abort the installation.

@ _pselect

A three-level hierarchy describes the software to be installed.  The
first first level is a software product, the second are the images
within the product, and the third are the subsystems within the
images.  An image is a major division within the product; typically
there is a "software" image and a "man page" image.  Each subsystem is
a logically or physically related set of files to be installed (or
removed) as a unit.

This series of questions allows you to select specific products,
images, and/or subsystems to be installed.  A "yes" or "no" answer at
any level applies to all lower levels as well (i.e. answering "yes" to
an image selects all subsystems within the image).  To pick and choose
among the lower level items answer "p".  This will give you the
opportunity to answer questions about each lower-level item (i.e. image
or subsystem).

@ _source

A distribution source is a location from which the distribution is to
be read.  This is normally cartridge tape; the name of the source would
be "/dev/nrtape", which is the no-rewind tape device.  The second most
likely source is a remote tape on a machine running the TCP/IP
protocol, which would be "hostname:/dev/nrtape".

@ _type

When a disk is new, or is being treated as new, the installation type
should be "build".  New file systems should be made when a build is
started; you will be asked about this momentarily.

When a disk is already in use and contains user files, and user-altered
configuration files, the new software should be installed as an
"update".  This will preserve as much of the existing disk data as
possible, without removing user files or user-altered configuration
files.

Answer "b" to start fresh, and "u" to install software on a
previously-running system.

@ _pick
 
The current series of questions allows you to select the software to be
installed from the software product(s) currently being accessed.  You will
select products, and then images within those products, and then subsystems
within those images.  There are three possible answers for these questions:

	pick	Select the product, image, or subsystem.  You will then be
		asked about each lower-level image and/or subsystem.

	yes	Select the product, image, or subsystem, and all lower-level
		images and/or subsystems.

	no	Reject the product, image, or subsystem, and all lower-level
		images and/or subsystems.

@ _space

Because the estimated number of disk blocks required to install the selected
software is greater than the number of disk blocks available, there is a
chance that the installation will fail due to lack of disk space.  If this
happens, the full file system will be left in an indeterminate state, and
recovery and/or reinstallation procedures will be required.  Possibilities:

	quit	Immediately terminate the installation tool.  Recommended
		for those who need help in solving the problem.

	sh	Escape to a UNIX subshell, from which "df" will report on
		space available as you remove unneeded files from /root and
		/root/usr.  Recommended only for those with UNIX experience.
	
	yes	Proceed with installation anyway.  Recommended for gamblers
		when the numbers are close.

	no	Discontinue current installation; remain in tool.  Recommended
		when a smaller set of software can be installed.

@ _required

Certain software products contain subsystems that are required for basic
system functionality.  Under any but the most unusual circumstances, these
subsystems should be installed.  You have deselected one or more such
subsystems by answering "n" to the subsystem, the image containing it, or
the product itself.  You can pass through the series of questions for this
product again by answering "y", and select the required subsystems, or
ignore the warning if you have reason to do so, and proceed with the
installation by answering "n".
