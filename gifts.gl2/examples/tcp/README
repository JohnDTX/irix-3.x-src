	These programs demonstrate how one can make a connection to
	another system using tcp (from an IRIS and to an IRIS) from
	within an IRIS program.

	To use these programs, accept.c, connect.c and select.c, run
	make. This will compile the programs.  First run 'accept' on
	machine 1, then run 'connect machine1' on machine 2 to make a
	connection.  Once the connection is established, everything
	you type on the connect side will appear on the accept side.
	To terminate the session, type EOF (ctrl-d) to the 'connect'
	program.  This will also cause the 'accept' program to terminate.

	For example:

	machine1% accept


	...

	<meanwhile at machine 2>
	machine2% connect machine1
	here is a message

	...

	<back at machine 1, the user should see>
	here is a message


	The 'select' program is another version of the 'accept'
	program that accepts repeated connections from the
	'connect' program.  Try the same sequence shown above,
	using 'select' in place of 'accept'.  Note that typing
	EOF (ctrl-d) on the connect side does not terminate the
	'select' program on the receiving side.  Invoke 'connect
	machine1' again and messages typed on machine2 will
	be echoed by 'select' on machine1.  Type a ctrl-c to
	terminate 'select' on machine1.
