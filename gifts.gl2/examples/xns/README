	These programs demonstrate how a program can make an xns
	connection (from an IRIS and to an IRIS) from within a program.

	To use these programs first run make. This will build xnscon
	and xnslis. Then run xnslis with a socket number on one machine
	(100 - 2000 are good numbers to use) Then run xnscon with a
	hostname and a socket number on the other machine.  Once a
	connection is established then everything typed on the connect
	side will appear on the listen side. To terminate the session
	type EOF (ctrl-d).
	For example:

	site1% xnslis 100
	...

	<from another site>
	site2% xnscon site1 100 
	this is a little message
	...


	<back at site 1>
	this is a little message
	<should appear on your screen>
