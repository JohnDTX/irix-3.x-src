KERMIT READMEfile

The files in these directories represent the Unix version 4D(060) of Kermit as
of 18 Apr 86. All other versions are available from Columbia University by means
described below.  Their brochure and order form follow.  

To install kermit in the system directories :

	su
	make install

This will copy the kermit binary into /usr/bin and will install the kermit
man page into /usr/man/u_man/man1. See kermit/doc/ckuker.doc for additional
information.

This is the Columbia University Kermit brochure and order form as of July 1986.
If a lot of time has passed since then, chances are that it will be obsolete,
in which case you should inquire at the address below or call 212-280-3703 to
find out if the terms and conditions have changed, or whether any new systems
have been added to the list of those supported by Kermit.

              POLICY ON COMMERCIAL USE AND DISTRIBUTION OF KERMIT

                                 Frank da Cruz

              Columbia University Center for Computing Activities

                                September, 1985


The KERMIT file transfer protocol has always been open, available, and free to
all.  The protocol was developed at the Columbia University Center for
Computing Activities, as were the first several KERMIT programs.  Columbia has
shared these programs freely with the worldwide computing community since 1981,
and as a result many individuals and institutions have contributed their own
improvements or new implementations in the same spirit.  In this manner, the
number of different systems supporting KERMIT implementations has grown from
three to over 100 in less than four years.  If Columbia had elected to keep
the protocol secret, to restrict access to source code, or to license the
software, the protocol would never have spread to cover so many systems, nor
would the programs be in use at so many sites, nor would the quality of many of
the implemementations be so high.

Although KERMIT is free and available to anyone who requests it, it is not in
the "public domain".  The protocol, the manuals, the Columbia implementations,
and many of the contributed implementations bear copyright notices dated 1981
or later, and include a legend like

  Copyright (C) 1985, Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York.
  Permission is granted to any individual or institution to use, copy, or
  redistribute this software so long as it is not sold for profit, provided
  this copyright notice is retained.

The copyright notice is to protect KERMIT, Columbia University, and the
various contributors from having their work usurped by others and sold as a
product.  In addition, the covering letter which we include with a KERMIT tape
states that KERMIT can be passed along to others; "we ask only that profit not
be your goal, credit be given where it is due, and that new material be sent
back to us so that we can maintain a definitive and comprehensive set of KERMIT
implementations".  

Within this framework, it is acceptable to charge a reproduction fee when
supplying KERMIT to others.  The reproduction fee may be designed to recover
costs of media, packaging, printing, shipping, order processing, or any
computer use required for reproduction.  The fee should not reflect any program
or documentation development effort, and it should be be independent of how
many implementations of KERMIT appear on the medium or where they came from.
It should not be viewed as a license fee.  For instance, when Columbia ships a
KERMIT tape, there is a $100.00 reproduction fee which includes a 2400' reel of
magnetic tape, two printed manuals, various flyers, a box, and postage; there
is an additional $100.00 order processing charge if an invoice must be sent.
The tape includes all known versions of KERMIT, including sources and
documentation.

Commercial institutions may make unlimited internal use of KERMIT, and
KERMIT may be installed on timesharing systems where customers are charged for
system use, so long as they are not charged more for using KERMIT than for
using any other program.

A question raised with increasing frequency is whether a company may
incorporate KERMIT into its products.  A hardware vendor may wish to include
KERMIT with its standard software.  A software house may wish to incorporate
KERMIT protocol into its communications package, or to distribute it along
with some other product.  A timesharing vendor or dialup database may wish to
provide KERMIT for downloading.  All these uses of KERMIT are permissible,
with the following provisos:

. A KERMIT program may not be sold as a product in and of itself.  In addition
  to violating the prevailing spirit of sharing and cooperation, commercial
  sale of a product called "KERMIT" could violate the trade mark which is held
  on that name by Henson Associates, Inc., creators of THE MUPPET SHOW.

. Existing KERMIT programs and documentation may be included with hardware or
  other software as part of a standard package, provided the price of the
  hardware or software product is not raised significantly beyond costs of
  reproduction of the KERMIT component.

. KERMIT protocol may be included in a multi-protocol communication package as
  one of the communication options, or as a communication feature of some
  other kind of software package, in order to enhance the attractiveness of the
  package.  KERMIT protocol file transfer and management should not be the
  primary purpose of the package.  The price of the package should not be
  raised significantly because KERMIT was included, and the vendor's literature
  should make a statement to this effect.

. Credit for development of the KERMIT protocol should be given to the Columbia
  University Center for Computing Activities, and customers should be advised
  that KERMIT is available for many systems for only a nominal fee from
  Columbia and from various user group organizations, such as DECUS and SHARE.

Columbia University may grant permission to any person or institution to
develop a KERMIT program for any particular system.  A commercial institution
that intends to distribute KERMIT under the conditions listed above should be
aware that other implementations of KERMIT for the same system may appear in
the standard KERMIT distribution at any time.  Columbia University encourages
all developers of KERMIT software and documentation to contribute their work
back to Columbia for further distribution.

Finally, Columbia University does not warrant in any way the KERMIT software
nor the accuracy of any related documentation, and neither the authors of any
KERMIT programs or documentation nor Columbia University nor any other
contributing institutions acknowledge any liability resulting from program or
documentation errors.

These are general guidelines; this is not a legal document to be searched for
loopholes.  To date, KERMIT has been freely shared by all who have taken the
time to do work on it, and no formal legalities have proven necessary.  The
guidelines are designed to allow commercial enterprises to participate in the
promulgation of KERMIT without seriously violating the KERMIT user community's
trust that KERMIT will continue to spread and improve at no significant cost to
themeselves.  The guidelines are subject to change at any time, should more
formal detail prove necessary.

Commercial organizations wishing to provide KERMIT to their customers should
write a letter stating their plans and their agreement to comply with the
guidelines listed above.  The letter should be addressed to:

                       THE KERMIT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

                                   July 1986



Kermit  is  an  error-correcting protocol for transferring sequential files be-
tween computers of  all  sizes  over  ordinary  asynchronous  telecommunication
lines.  Kermit is non-proprietary, thoroughly documented, and in wide use.  The
protocol and the original implementations were developed at Columbia University
and  have  been shared with thousands of other institutions all over the world,
many of which have made significant contributions of  their  own.    Kermit  is
presently available for more than 200 different machines and operating systems,
and additional versions are always under development.

All Kermit programs perform  file  transfer  using  the  Kermit  file  transfer
protocol.    In  addition,  Kermit programs for personal computers also provide
terminal emulation, usually of the DEC VT52, VT100, or  similar  terminal,  and
some  of  the  mainframe Kermit programs are capable of initiating connections,
acting as dumb terminals to remote systems.  Kermit  programs  work  only  over
asynchronous  RS-232 direct or dialup connections, or connections that simulate
them.  For file transfer to take place, there must be a Kermit program  running
on each end of the connection, one on each computer.

There are Kermit programs for most popular "generic" operating systems, includ-
ing UNIX, MS-DOS, and CP/M, and for  mainframes  and  minicomputers  from  Bur-
roughs,   Cray,  CDC,  Data  General,  DEC,  Gould  (SEL),  Harris,  Honeywell,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Perkin-Elmer, Prime, Sperry/Univac, and Tandem,  and  for
particular  microcomputers  and  workstations  from  Apple, Apollo, Atari, Com-
modore, IBM, Tandy, and many others, written in a wide variety of languages in-
cluding many different assemblers, plus high-level languages like Algol, Basic,
Bliss, C, Forth, Fortran, Lisp, Mumps, Pascal, PL/I, and Ratfor.    A  complete
list of Kermit programs accompanies this flyer.

Here  are some details about the several most popular Kermit programs.  Most of
the following implementations are capable of both local and  remote  operation,
server  and  client  modes,  text  and binary file transfer, and support a full
range of communications options -- speed, parity, duplex, flow  control,  hand-
shake  --  to  allow  adaptation  to  a  wide  variety  of hosts (including IBM
mainframes) and communication media.

   - IBM PC Kermit Version 2.29 runs under PC-DOS version 2.0 and later on
     the entire IBM PC family, as well as on IBM "clones" and compatibles.
     It provides nearly complete DEC VT102 terminal emulation at speeds up
     to  38.4K  baud  fully  buffered and interrupt driven -- and includes
     support for  color  displays,  compatibility  with  various  "desktop
     organizers,"  and selectable emulation of other terminals.  There are
     also versions of Kermit specifically tailored for a variety of  other
     MS-DOS  systems,  including the DEC Rainbow, Zenith-100, Victor 9000,
     HP-110/150, and many others, and there is a "generic"  MS-DOS  Kermit
     for systems not explicitly covered.

   - Macintosh  Kermit  Version  0.8  runs  on  the entire Apple Macintosh
     family, from the original 128K Mac to the Mac/XL, to the  fully  con-
     figured  Macintosh-Plus.  It provides fairly complete VT102 emulation
     at speeds up to 9600 baud, and file transfer up to 56Kb.


   - UNIX Kermit is distributed only in C-language source form.  It may be
     built  for  nearly any machine running practically any post-V6 varia-
     tion of UNIX, including V7, Berkeley 2.x and 4.x, AT&T System III and
     System  V, Xenix, Venix, and so on.  The same source also serves as a
     basis for Macintosh, Amiga, and other Kermit programs.

   - VAX/VMS Kermit is written in Bliss, but it  is  also  distributed  in
     Macro-32  and  hex  form,  so  that a Bliss compiler is not required.
     Other versions exist in C and Pascal.

   - IBM mainframe Kermit programs for VM/CMS and MVS/TSO work  only  with
     asynchronous  ASCII  TTY connections through 3705 or equivalent front
     ends, or through Series/1, 7171, or similar protocol converters  that
     support  the Yale ASCII Communications System; beyond this exception,
     Kermit cannot be  used  to  transfer  files  in  the  IBM  3270-style
     full-screen  terminal  environment.  There are no Kermit programs for
     DOS/VSE, or IBM minis like the System/34 and System/38, because these
     systems do not support asynchronous ASCII communications.  Currently,
     IBM mainframe Kermits run only in remote mode.

The Kermit software -- including source code -- is furnished free  and  without
license, and without warranty of any kind, and neither Columbia University, nor
the individual  authors,  nor  any  institution  that  has  contributed  Kermit
material, acknowledge any liability for any claims arising from the use of Ker-
mit.  Furthermore, it must be stated that the quality of  the  Kermit  programs
varies  --  some are polished, well-documented professional products and others
are not.  Kermit programs are contributed by  public-spirited  volunteers,  and
Columbia  University does not wish to discourage such contributions by subject-
ing them to a rating system.  Since source code is provided for  all  implemen-
tations, users may make improvements or write documentation where it is lacking
and are encouraged to contribute their work back to Columbia for  further  dis-
tribution.    Under  certain  conditions  (described  in  a  separate document)
software producers may include Kermit protocol in their products.

Although the Kermit software is free and unlicensed, Columbia University cannot
afford  to  distribute  it for free because the demand is too great.  To defray
our costs for media, printing, postage, labor, and computing resources, we  re-
quire  moderate  distribution  fees from those who request Kermit directly from
us.  The schedule is given on the accompanying Kermit Order Form.  You may also
obtain  Kermit  programs  from  many other sources, including user groups, net-
works, dialup bulletin boards, and you may copy them from  friends,  neighbors,
and  colleagues.    In  fact, you may obtain Kermit programs from anyone who is
willing to share them with you, just as you may share them yourself.

Kermit is distributed by Columbia  University  primarily  on  9-track  magnetic
tape,  suitable for reading on most mainframe and minicomputers.  It is assumed
that Kermit will be ordered in this form  by  institutional  computer  centers,
whose  professional  staff will take the responsibility for "bootstrapping" the
microcomputer versions from the tape to diskettes for their users.   The  tapes
include  source  code and any available documentation for each Kermit implemen-
tation, and in some cases also binaries (usually encoded in hex or other print-
able format).  Selected microcomputer versions are also available from Columbia
on diskette.

Documentation includes the Kermit User Guide, which contains complete  instruc-


tions  for  using  and  installing the major implementations of Kermit, and the
Kermit Protocol Manual, which is a guide to writing new Kermit programs.    One
printed  copy  of  each  manual is included with any tape order, and additional
copies may be ordered separately.  The manuscript from the Kermit article  that
appeared  in  the  June  and  July  1984  issues of BYTE Magazine, and the book
Kermit, A File Transfer Protocol (Frank da Cruz, Digital Press, 1986) may  also
be ordered separately.

Once  you  receive Kermit, you are encouraged to copy and redistribute it, with
the following stipulations: Kermit should not be sold for profit; credit should
be  given  where  it  is  due; and new material should be sent back to Columbia
University so that we can maintain a definitive and comprehensive set of Kermit
implementations  for further distribution.  And finally, please use Kermit only
for peaceful and humane purposes.
                             ORDERING INFORMATION

There are two separate Kermit tapes, A and B. There are too many  Kermit  files
to  fit  on  a  single tape (soon, there will be too many to fit on two tapes).
All tapes are half-inch, 2400-foot, 9-track, 1600bpi, odd  parity.    They  are
available ONLY in the following formats:

  ANSI:   ANSI labeled ASCII, format D (variable length records, VMS COPY)
  TAR:    UNIX TAR format (written on a VAX with 4.2bsd or Ultrix-32)
  OS:     IBM OS standard labeled EBCDIC, format VB (variable length records)
  CMS:    IBM VM/CMS VMFPLC2 format (unlabeled)
  DEC-10: DECsystem-10 Backup/Interchange format (unlabeled)
  DEC-20: DECSYSTEM-20 DUMPER format (unlabeled)

Blocksizes,  when  applicable,  are  our choice and in the range 8K-10K (use of
smaller blocksizes could overflow the tapes).  NO OTHER FORMATS ARE  AVAILABLE.
We  can  NOT  make  800bpi  or  6250bpi tapes, unlabeled tapes (except as noted
above), fixed-block tapes, or custom tapes of any kind.  If none of  the  above
formats  looks  familiar to you, then specify ANSI -- this is an industry stan-
dard format that should be readable by any computer system.

Tapes include machine readable source for both programs and documentation.

TAPE "A" CONTAINS:
   - The microcomputer (PC, workstation) Kermit implementations
   - The Info-Kermit mail archive

TAPE "B" CONTAINS:
   - The mainframe and minicomputer Kermit implementations.
   - The Kermit User Guide and the Kermit Protocol Manual

EXCEPTIONS:
   - C-Kermit is the basis of all Unix Kermit  implementations,  mainframe
     and  micro.    It  is on tape B. Macintosh and Amiga Kermits are also
     generated from  the  C-Kermit  sources,  so  they  too  are  on  tape
     B.  Duplicate copies of the Macintosh and Amiga hex and doc files (no
     source) are also included on tape A for convenience.

   - While the general documentation is on tape B, any documentation of  a
     specific   nature   is  distributed  together  with  the  program  it
     describes.

Kermit diskettes may also be ordered in certain formats; see the order form.
