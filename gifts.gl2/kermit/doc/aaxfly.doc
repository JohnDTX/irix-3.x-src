                       THE KERMIT FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOL

                                   July 1986



Kermit  is  an  error-correcting protocol for transferring sequential files be-
tween computers of  all  sizes  over  ordinary  asynchronous  telecommunication
lines.  Kermit is non-proprietary, thoroughly documented, and in wide use.  The
protocol and the original implementations were developed at Columbia University
and  have  been shared with thousands of other institutions all over the world,
many of which have made significant contributions of  their  own.    Kermit  is
presently available for more than 200 different machines and operating systems,
and additional versions are always under development.

All Kermit programs perform  file  transfer  using  the  Kermit  file  transfer
protocol.    In  addition,  Kermit programs for personal computers also provide
terminal emulation, usually of the DEC VT52, VT100, or  similar  terminal,  and
some  of  the  mainframe Kermit programs are capable of initiating connections,
acting as dumb terminals to remote systems.  Kermit  programs  work  only  over
asynchronous  RS-232 direct or dialup connections, or connections that simulate
them.  For file transfer to take place, there must be a Kermit program  running
on each end of the connection, one on each computer.

There are Kermit programs for most popular "generic" operating systems, includ-
ing UNIX, MS-DOS, and CP/M, and for  mainframes  and  minicomputers  from  Bur-
roughs,   Cray,  CDC,  Data  General,  DEC,  Gould  (SEL),  Harris,  Honeywell,
Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Perkin-Elmer, Prime, Sperry/Univac, and Tandem,  and  for
particular  microcomputers  and  workstations  from  Apple, Apollo, Atari, Com-
modore, IBM, Tandy, and many others, written in a wide variety of languages in-
cluding many different assemblers, plus high-level languages like Algol, Basic,
Bliss, C, Forth, Fortran, Lisp, Mumps, Pascal, PL/I, and Ratfor.    A  complete
list of Kermit programs accompanies this flyer.

Here  are some details about the several most popular Kermit programs.  Most of
the following implementations are capable of both local and  remote  operation,
server  and  client  modes,  text  and binary file transfer, and support a full
range of communications options -- speed, parity, duplex, flow  control,  hand-
shake  --  to  allow  adaptation  to  a  wide  variety  of hosts (including IBM
mainframes) and communication media.

   - IBM PC Kermit Version 2.29 runs under PC-DOS version 2.0 and later on
     the entire IBM PC family, as well as on IBM "clones" and compatibles.
     It provides nearly complete DEC VT102 terminal emulation at speeds up
     to  38.4K  baud  fully  buffered and interrupt driven -- and includes
     support for  color  displays,  compatibility  with  various  "desktop
     organizers,"  and selectable emulation of other terminals.  There are
     also versions of Kermit specifically tailored for a variety of  other
     MS-DOS  systems,  including the DEC Rainbow, Zenith-100, Victor 9000,
     HP-110/150, and many others, and there is a "generic"  MS-DOS  Kermit
     for systems not explicitly covered.

   - Macintosh  Kermit  Version  0.8  runs  on  the entire Apple Macintosh
     family, from the original 128K Mac to the Mac/XL, to the  fully  con-
     fi ured   ac nt sh-P us.   t p ovid s fairly co pl te VT

   - UNIX Kermit is distributed only in C-language source form.  It may be
     built  for  nearly any machine running practically any post-V6 varia-
     tion of UNIX, including V7, Berkeley 2.x and 4.x, AT&T System III and
     System  V, Xenix, Venix, and so on.  The same source also serves as a
     basis for Macintosh, Amiga, and other Kermit programs.

   - VAX/VMS Kermit is written in Bliss, but it  is  also  distributed  in
     Macro-32  and  hex  form,  so  that a Bliss compiler is not required.
     Other versions exist in C and Pascal.

   - IBM mainframe Kermit programs for VM/CMS and MVS/TSO work  only  with
     asynchronous  ASCII  TTY connections through 3705 or equivalent front
     ends, or through Series/1, 7171, or similar protocol converters  that
     support  the Yale ASCII Communications System; beyond this exception,
     Kermit cannot be  used  to  transfer  files  in  the  IBM  3270-style
     full-screen  terminal  environment.  There are no Kermit programs for
     DOS/VSE, or IBM minis like the System/34 and System/38, because these
     systems do not support asynchronous ASCII communications.  Currently,
     IBM mainframe Kermits run only in remote mode.

The Kermit software -- including source code -- is furnished free  and  without
license, and without warranty of any kind, and neither Columbia University, nor
the individual  authors,  nor  any  institution  that  has  contributed  Kermit
material, acknowledge any liability for any claims arising from the use of Ker-
mit.  Furthermore, it must be stated that the quality of  the  Kermit  programs
varies  --  some are polished, well-documented professional products and others
are not.  Kermit programs are contributed by  public-spirited  volunteers,  and
Columbia  University does not wish to discourage such contributions by subject-
ing them to a rating system.  Since source code is provided for  all  implemen-
tations, users may make improvements or write documentation where it is lacking
and are encouraged to contribute their work back to Columbia for  further  dis-
tribution.    Under  certain  conditions  (described  in  a  separate document)
software producers may include Kermit protocol in their products.

Although the Kermit software is free and unlicensed, Columbia University cannot
afford  to  distribute  it for free because the demand is too great.  To defray
our costs for media, printing, postage, labor, and computing resources, we  re-
quire  moderate  distribution  fees from those who request Kermit directly from
us.  The schedule is given on the accompanying Kermit Order Form.  You may also
obtain  Kermit  programs  from  many other sources, including user groups, net-
works, dialup bulletin boards, and you may copy them from  friends,  neighbors,
and  colleagues.    In  fact, you may obtain Kermit programs from anyone who is
willing to share them with you, just as you may share them yourself.

Kermit is distributed by Columbia  University  primarily  on  9-track  magnetic
tape,  suitable for reading on most mainframe and minicomputers.  It is assumed
that Kermit will be ordered in this form  by  institutional  computer  centers,
whose  professional  staff will take the responsibility for "bootstrapping" the
microcomputer versions from the tape to diskettes for their users.   The  tapes
include  source  code and any available documentation for each Kermit implemen-
tation, and in some cases also binaries (usually encoded in hex or other print-
able format).  Selected microcomputer versions are also available from Columbia
on diskette.

Documentation includes the Kermit User Guide, which contains complete  instruc-


tions  for  using  and  installing the major implementations of Kermit, and the
Kermit Protocol Manual, which is a guide to writing new Kermit programs.    One
printed  copy  of  each  manual is included with any tape order, and additional
copies may be ordered separately.  The manuscript from the Kermit article  that
appeared  in  the  June  and  July  1984  issues of BYTE Magazine, and the book
Kermit, A File Transfer Protocol (Frank da Cruz, Digital Press, 1986) may  also
be ordered separately.

Once  you  receive Kermit, you are encouraged to copy and redistribute it, with
the following stipulations: Kermit should not be sold for profit; credit should
be  given  where  it  is  due; and new material should be sent back to Columbia
University so that we can maintain a definitive and comprehensive set of Kermit
implementations  for further distribution.  And finally, please use Kermit only
for peaceful and humane purposes.
                             ORDERING INFORMATION

There are two separate Kermit tapes, A and B. There are too many  Kermit  files
to  fit  on  a  single tape (soon, there will be too many to fit on two tapes).
All tapes are half-inch, 2400-foot, 9-track, 1600bpi, odd  parity.    They  are
available ONLY in the following formats:

  ANSI:   ANSI labeled ASCII, format D (variable length records, VMS COPY)
  TAR:    UNIX TAR format (written on a VAX with 4.2bsd or Ultrix-32)
  OS:     IBM OS standard labeled EBCDIC, format VB (variable length records)
  CMS:    IBM VM/CMS VMFPLC2 format (unlabeled)
  DEC-10: DECsystem-10 Backup/Interchange format (unlabeled)
  DEC-20: DECSYSTEM-20 DUMPER format (unlabeled)

Blocksizes,  when  applicable,  are  our choice and in the range 8K-10K (use of
smaller blocksizes could overflow the tapes).  NO OTHER FORMATS ARE  AVAILABLE.
We  can  NOT  make  800bpi  or  6250bpi tapes, unlabeled tapes (except as noted
above), fixed-block tapes, or custom tapes of any kind.  If none of  the  above
formats  looks  familiar to you, then specify ANSI -- this is an industry stan-
dard format that should be readable by any computer system.

Tapes include machine readable source for both programs and documentation.

TAPE "A" CONTAINS:
   - The microcomputer (PC, workstation) Kermit implementations
   - The Info-Kermit mail archive

TAPE "B" CONTAINS:
   - The mainframe and minicomputer Kermit implementations.
   - The Kermit User Guide and the Kermit Protocol Manual

EXCEPTIONS:
   - C-Kermit is the basis of all Unix Kermit  implementations,  mainframe
     and  micro.    It  is on tape B. Macintosh and Amiga Kermits are also
     generated from  the  C-Kermit  sources,  so  they  too  are  on  tape
     B.  Duplicate copies of the Macintosh and Amiga hex and doc files (no
     source) are also included on tape A for convenience.

   - While the general documentation is on tape B, any documentation of  a
     specific   nature   is  distributed  together  with  the  program  it
     describes.

Kermit diskettes may also be ordered in certain formats; see the order form.
