               Second Pre-Release of C-Kermit for Unix

----------------------------------------------------------------------

From: Frank da Cruz <SY.FDC@CU20B>
Subject: Second Pre-Release of C-Kermit for Unix
To: Info-Kermit@CU20B

This is to announce the second "pre-release" of C-Kermit.  The first
pre-release (version 4.0) occurred a month ago; the program included
support only for Berkeley Unix.  This new release (4.2) includes support
for:

. 4.x Berkeley Unix (VAX, SUN)
. Generic AT&T System III, System V
. Microsoft Xenix for the PC/AT
. Interactive on the PC/XT (PC/IX) and other systems
. DEC Professional 3xx with Venix 1.0
. NCR Tower

All reported bugs have been fixed (or at least fixes have been
attempted), and many of the restrictions lifted.  "Dial" and "script"
commands have been added, along with code to support modem control and
dialers, uucp line locking, and the like.  The program itself has been
somewhat reorganized to be more adaptable to small environments: the
larger modules have been split; long character strings have been
shortened.

Most of the new work was done by Herm Fischer of Litton Data Systems, Van
Nuys CA (HFISCHER@USC-ISIB), and there were also contributions from many
others in the form of bug reports and/or fixes.  NCR Tower support came
from John Bray at Auburn University.  The new makefile (distributed as
CKERMI.MAK) embodies procedures for building all the different versions.

Since the program now runs on a variety computers, large and small, it
would seem relatively safe to begin adding support for other systems
without fear that the program will have to be completely reorganized
(again).  The only systems supported by C-Kermit so far are Unix systems;
rather than create a separate ckx and ckz module for each such system
(since these systems tend to differ in small places, but still have much
in common), conditional compilation was used within these modules.  If
C-Kermit is to be adapted to non-Unix systems, then a full replacement of
the ckx and/or ckz modules is probably indicated.  This is what we will
probably do in bringing the program up on the Macintosh.

The files are available via anonymous FTP from Internet host CU20B
(Internet number 192.5.43.128) as KER:CK*.*.  They will appear at
okstate (for uucp'ing) and on KERMSRV (BITnet) shortly.  If you plan to
adapt this program to a new system, be sure to let me know quickly so I
can prevent duplication of effort and can put people with similar
interests in touch with each other.
