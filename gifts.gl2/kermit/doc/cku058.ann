This is to announce a new release of C-Kermit.  It is only a minor release,
and incorporates no new functionality.  The only intention is to fix the
more serious bugs.  Future releases will involve more serious reworking of
the code to improve organization and performance, and to add missing features,
like extended packets, sliding windows, and attribute packets.

The new release is called 4C(058), for UNIX and VMS.  The fixes that
apply to all (or most) systems supported by C-Kermit include:
. Bug with set send/receive padding fixed.
. Bugs that interfered with wildcard sends fixed.
. Bug that mixed up send and receive packet terminators fixed.
. Bug with single-file cancellation (^F or ^X) fixed.
. NAK for next packet now handled correctly as equivalent to ACK for current.
. NAK is no longer immediately sent after RECEIVE or SERVER command given.
. Long bursts of incoming data no longer crash the program.
. Longer sleep done at end of file transfer to prevent other side from hanging.
. ^S removed from among CONNECT escape character arguments.
. Dial pause of 0 no longer causes problems.

The fixes specific to UNIX include:
. Fixed support for 2.9 BSD (tested on DEC Pro 380).
. New makefile entry for Masscomp (untested).
. Some 0's in system calls changed to NULLs.
. SET SEND/RECEIVE TIMEOUT 0 no longer prevents file transfer from working.

VMS changes (untested):
. '!' should now spawn an interactive DCL.
. REMOTE commands to VMS C-Kermit server should now work.

The new version of Macintosh Kermit that is based on C-Kermit is not
ready yet because it's too big for our SUMACC cc68 cross-compiler to
handle.  We're trying to dig up a version of cc68 with an expanded
symbol table (anybody have one we can FTP?).
