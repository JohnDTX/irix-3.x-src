OKLAHOMA STATE UNIVERSITY KERMIT DIALUP ACCESS


UUCP and Kermit access to the complete Kermit distribution is available from
the Department of Computing and Information Sciences, Oklahoma State 
University, Stillwater, Oklahoma.

The files from TAPE A are in /usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-a/*

The files from TAPE B are in /usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-b/*


 -- UUCP --

You need to set up "okstate" as a site in your "L.sys" UUCP dialing file
using the information listed below.  You can then issue the following 
commands on your system:

   uucp okstate!~uucp/kermit-a/aaaread.me /usr/spool/uucppublic

   (this example will retrieve a general information file about the entire
    Kermit Distribution.  DO THIS FIRST!)

   uucp okstate!~uucp/kermit-b/ck\* /usr/spool/uucppublic

   (this example will retrieve the current version of C-Kermit)

"/usr/spool/uucppublic" was chosen as the destination on your system since
the destination must be WIDE OPEN (drwxrwxrwx) to everyone.  You should not
remove files from your uucppublic until the entire transfer is complete
including any redials that are necessary.  If you do remove some files, our
system may retransmit them, resulting in a higher phone bill for you.

There are 2 files available that contain information about the entire
distribution.  We recommend that you retrieve these files first.  They are
"aaaread.me" which explains the file name conventions used, and "aafiles.dir"
which is a complete listing (by name) of all files in the in each kermit
directory.  These files will enable you to choose the right files the first
time to save those high dollar phone bills.

Just a few notes on how to best retrieve parts of the Kermit distribution
using UUCP...

  -  Install the proper L.sys entry and test it using the debugging option
     of UUCICO (-x).  Repeat this step until you successfully complete a
     "no work" connection, this will verify that your L.sys entry is correct
     and will minimize frazzled nerves.

  -  Retrieve the files `aaaread.me' and `aafiles.dir' with the following
     commands:

uucp -c -d okstate!~uucp/kermit-a/aaaread.me  /usr/spool/uucppublic
uucp -c -d okstate!~uucp/kermit-a/aafiles.dir /usr/spool/uucppublic/files.dir.a
uucp -c -d okstate!~uucp/kermit-b/aafiles.dir /usr/spool/uucppublic/files.dir.b

     You will have to escape the exclamation point and the tilde if you are
     using the C shell (i.e. ...okstate\!\~uucp/kermit-a...).

  -  Choose the versions of Kermit that you wish to transfer and issue the
     proper UUCP command.  Some systems don't seem to like wildcards, but
     in any case the wildcards will have to be escaped from your shell. The
     following command would retrieve the files relating to C-Kermit:

uucp -c -d okstate!~uucp/kermit-b/ck\* /usr/spool/uucppublic

     PLEASE NOTE THE USE OF /usr/spool/uucppublic!  Unless you *really* 
     understand how UUCP's protections work you should not change this!  A
     number of people have queued >100 files and had their systems refuse
     to store them in out of the way places.  This results in wasted phone
     time!



KERMIT SERVER ACCESS TO THE KERMIT DISTRIBUTION AREA.

Okstate also provides access to the KERMIT distribution via a KERMIT Server.
The number is the same as above for the uucpker login, so the line may be busy
quite a bit.  This server is a specialized server with controlled access.  At
present, the server is only allowed access to the KERMIT directories on our
machine.  

                      Path names for the C-KERMIT server:

          1.   The server does not allow  relative  paths.   You  must
               fully  qualify  the directory and filename.  If you are
               in the directory of a file you wish to access, then the
               directory name is not needed.

          2.   No password is needed for the directory  change.   Just
               specify  the  proper path (selected from the list shown
               when the server starts up).  Again, relative paths  are
               not allowed.

          3.   When you use the  REMOTE  DIRECTORY  command,  remember
               that  there are a great number of files in the 2 direc-
               tories currently accessible by the server.  This  means
               that  it  will  take  a little while for the listing to
               come back to you.

          4.   All filenames are case sensitive,  and  currently,  all
               lower case.  This means that

                    /USR/SPOOL/UUCPPUBLIC/KERMIT-A/AA*

               is an INVALID file name to the server, while

                    /usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-a/aa*

               IS a valid file name that the server will recognize.

          5.   The messages returned by the server in the acknowledge-
               ment, and error packets are very helpful.  If a partic-
               ular KERMIT does not print the messages, then  it  will
               be difficult to know what is really going wrong.

          6.   Wildcarding is allowed.  At this time,  only  '*',  and
               '?'  are  recognized  as  wildcard characters.  As with
               most Unix wildcarding, '*' represents zero or  more  of
               any  character,  including  '.', and '?' represents any
               single character, also including '.'.  Thus,  ck*.*  is
               equivalent  to  ck* for all filenames containing a '.',
               and ck?*  is  not  equivelent  to  ck*  Since  the  '?'
               requires that a character be present.


                         What the startup information means:

               When the server starts up, several pieces  of  informa-
          tion are printed out.  Below is a sample:

               Server capabilities:

               GET      DIR      TYPE     CWD      JOURNAL

               max-on-time = `-2'
               max-idle   = `600'

               Home directory: `/usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-a'
               Alternate path: `/usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-a: r'
               Alternate path: `/usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-b: r'

               The information given above,  describes  the  types  of
          functions the server can perform, the time limits associated
          with the server, and the paths that you may  use  to  access
          the   KERMIT   distribution.    The   value  of  max-on-time
          represents the maximum length of a session.  In  this  case,
          the  value  `-2'  means  infinite.   The  value  of max-idle
          represents the maximum time that can elapse between transac-
          tions  before the session terminates.  The value given is in
          seconds, so 10 minutes is the  limit.   If  max-on-time  was
          enforced, its value would also be in seconds.

               The "Home directory" path is  the  directory  that  the
          server starts the session in.  Since it is also an alternate
          path, it is listed as one.  The letters appearing after  the
          ':'  in  the Alternate path names, represent the permissions
          applicable in that directory.  'r' is for READ.   The  other
          possibilities  are 'w' - WRITE, 'd' - DELETE, and 'x' - EXE-
          CUTE.


                             Transaction journaling


               A complete list of the transactions that  each  session
          makes  is  maintained.  You may retrieve a copy of the tran-
          saction by using the REMOTE commands associated  with  jour-
          nals.   The information within the journal represents all of
          the data and information associated  with  the  transactions
          carried out for the session.

               The server supports all of the journal functions listed
          in  the  KERMIT  protocol  manual,  .../kermit-a/kproto.doc.
          Transaction files can be named, if an argument is  given  to
          the  REMOTE  START-LOG  command.   Only the base name of the
          file name will be used.  An example series of command to the
          server might be:

               KERMIT> remote start-log files
               KERMIT> remote cwd /usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-b
               KERMIT> get ck*
               KERMIT> get hp*
               KERMIT> remote cwd /usr/spool/uucppublic/kermit-a
               KERMIT> get ms*
               KERMIT> remote send-log

               The resulting log would contain information about which
          file  were  transferred  and  the  times associated with the
          transfer.  The final command, remote send-log, would  result
          in the file "files" being sent to the users' host.  It could
          then be reviewed at a later date to  verify  what  had  been
          transferred.

You need the following information in order to access the server.

KERMIT login   :   kermsrv
Password       :   piggy
Parity         :   even
Data path      :   7 bit
Available      :   24 hours/day, 7 days a week

When the login is completed, the server will start, and you should escape
back to your local KERMIT to issue further commands.  If the server remains
idle for a period of time around 10 minutes, it will be stopped.  While the
server is receiving data other than NAK packets, it will continue to run.

The best place to start after logging on is "REMOTE HELP", followed closely by
the desired "REMOTE DIR" commands.  If you don't include an argument to REMOTE
DIR, you should be prepared for more than 600 lines of output.  It is usually
better to read the 'aaaread.me' file (using REMOTE TYPE perhaps) and then do
the DIR with some kind of wildcard (like "REMOTE DIR ck*").

Remember that if your KERMIT does not support remote commands, then you can
get files from either directory by preceding the file name with the proper
path, as in:

	get /usr/spool/uucp/kermit-b/ck*
