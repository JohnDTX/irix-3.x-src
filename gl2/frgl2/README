This directory has been reworked to produce only lib.f
for standard "make install" durring the release procces.

The rest of this file is of historical interest only, next time I'm in
here I will blow it away.

~/host/f77

This directory is set up for making the remote Fortran library and associated
files.  It needs $IRIS/lib.prim (the same lib.prim used for c and local
Fortran).  Everything else needed is here.  I just ran the Makefile, and it
works on olympus with everything where it is.

lib.f and fgl.h should be useable for any host, not just UNIX bsd4.2 on a VAX.
io.f, with customization, should be similarly useful.  fsys.c, on the other
hand, is likely to need a rewrite for each host the Fortran graphics library
is ported to.

'mandefs.fr' is a new innovation which as much as possible mimics the function
call definitions in the gl2 manual.  It is very useful for checking the manual
against to keep it correct and up to date, as it is automatically generated
whenever a new graphics library is compiled.  I suggest regularly sending a
copy to the documentation department.  'mandefs.cr' is available for c, too.

As much as possible, intelligence was taken out of the awk script and put into
lib.prim.  'trybad' is used to try frlibgen.awk with a lib.prim with many
errors in it, thereby trying many of the error conditions and messages in the
awk script.

I don't know why defgen.awk, param.awk, or the generic directories are here.
If they aren't needed, remove them.  Also, I didn't do any work with dliris,
so I commented it out of the Makefile.
