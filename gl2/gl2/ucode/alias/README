		>>>  UPDATE  <<<		1/14/85


Here is a fixed up version of some of the files in the ./ucode subtree
in the microcode development release.

It contains a new mas.doc which documents the changes,
which are here summarized.


o The keyword enddeclares is no longer understood or required in the scratch
	declaration syntax.

o Added the function decl() as a substitute for declare(), blok(), and
	external.

o The function scratchlookup() has been revised and _slookup() has been added
	for use by decl().  Scratchlookup() prints error messages on stdout
	for common symbol lookup errors, and is used by the scratch() and
	sarray() macros.  _slookup() looks up in the correct symbol table.

o A "file counter" is now used to keep track of whether a scratch symbol is
	declared in the file in which it is used.  Define NOFILECHECK in the
	Makefile to override this test.

o Fixed the external declaration mechanism to not allocate extra space.

o Added the sreloc() function to allow relocation of scratch symbols.
