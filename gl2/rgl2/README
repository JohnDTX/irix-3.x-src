~/host/c

This directory is set up for making the remote c library and associated
files.  It needs $GLROOT/lib/$GLHDWR/lib.prim 
(the same lib.prim used for remote c and
Fortran).
Everything else needed is here.  I just ran the Makefile, and it
works on olympus with everything where it is.

lib.c, io.c, and rgl.h should be useable for most any host running UNIX System
V or bsd4.2.  Note the compiler switches described in the comments at the 
beginning of io.c.

'mandefs.cr' is a new innovation which as much as possible mimics the function
call definitions in the gl2 manual.  It is very useful for checking the manual
against to keep it correct and up to date, as it is automatically generated
whenever a new graphics library is compiled.  I suggest regularly sending a
copy to the documentation department.  'mandefs.fr' is available for Fortran,
too.

As much as possible, intelligence was taken out of the awk script and put into
lib.prim.  'trybad' is used to try frlibgen.awk with a lib.prim with many
errors in it, thereby trying many of the error conditions and messages in the
awk script.
