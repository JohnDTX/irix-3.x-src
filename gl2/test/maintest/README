This is Ron G.'s RGL test suite (maintest) originally written for testing 
the VMS FORTRAN RGL.  Only the include file syntax needs changing to have it
compile under UNIX.  This is done with a sed script (see Makefile).

Two programs are made from this source:
    - rgltest: this can be used to test a host FORTRAN RGL or a
      terminal program (iris or wsiris).
    - fgltest: this can be used to test the local FORTRAN wrapper library.
