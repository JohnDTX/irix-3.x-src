		T3279 menu version 1.3  revised 2 April 86
		Peter Ecclesine

The t3279 arguments are: t3279 [-dgiotvz] [inputfile]
	d	log 3278 text displayed in pxlog (terminal emulation screens)
	g	log RGL commands as text in LOGFILE.x
	i	input is ascii RGL file (RDDATA type file)
	o	log RGL ascii as hex from/to host in RDDATA.x WRDATA.x or else
		log normal messages in MSGDATA.x
	t	use textport for 3278 emulation(Release 2.4,3.4)
	v	use visual 50 textport for 3278 emulation(Release 2.3,3.3.1)
	z	use gbegin for xginit, rather than ginit to save color map

	The t3279 program menu has 24 customer entries, and reside in
the dbgmenu.c program. The entries are:

	!~		Shell escape.
	1:		Display the menu entries
	2:		3270 terminal emulation, displaying the first 10
			bytes of any received message on the status line.
			The message transfer protocol is supported to
			receive messages only.
	3:		3270/Remote Graphics Library
			implimentation. The full message transfer protocol
			is supported.
	4:		3270/File Transfer 
			implimentation. The full message transfer protocol
			is supported. See updown for UDT documentation.
	5 (dd):		The GeometryLink self test diagnostic is
			run for dd times. Each successful run will display
			00 00 01 01 .. 18 18. The number displayed if the
			test does not reach 18 is an index to the trouble.
	6 (dd):		The GeometryLink static receive ram is tested,
			and passes, or returns an error code indicating the
			pattern that failed.
	7 filename [adego]: dump file to screen
			a - display ascii hex and translation
			d,g - literal ascii dump
			e - display ebcdic hex and translation
			o - ascii with RGL hilit (10 and 7e)
	8 [gtv]:	select type of 3270 emulation
			g - 3279 graphport (full keyboard)
			t - 3278 textport (vt100 keyboard, release 2.4,3.4)
			v - 3278 textport (visual 50, vt52 keyboard,2.3,3.3.1)
	9:		Causes the clock message to be transmitted to the
			host computer. Possible error codes are:
				1 - length > 1900 characters or zero or negative
				2 - no response from host processor after
				    ENTER aid(functions.c has details)
				3 - host input buffer full.
				5 - 3274 not able to unlock keyboard - probable
				    host to 3274 problem
				6 - write to i/f retries exceeded - probable
				    GeometryLink card or 3274 polling problem
				7 - write to GeometryLink card failed - probable
				    kernel software or GeometryLink problem.
				9 or greater - a received message
	10:		Causes the quit message to be transmitted to the
			host computer.
	11 [dgo]:	selects logging option for t3279
			d - log 3270 emulation text screens in pxlog
			g - log RGL commands in LOGFILE.x
			o - log host messages: menu 2 in MSGDATA.x,
					menu 3, 33 in RDDATA.x WRDATA.x
	12 [dgo]:	closes logging option
			d - close pxlog
			g - close LOGFILE.x
			o - close RDDATA.x WRDATA.x MSGDATA.x
	13 filename:	Replay the host RGL from file "filename", (RDDATA type)
	14 (dd):	Update the 3278 screen buffer by calling update3270.
			'dd' messages can be received by this routine.
	15:		Display the current 3278 screen for a second.
	16:		'print'(hex) the 3278 screen, surpressing nulls.
	17 filename [f]: Convert the TEXTFILE in preparation for upload. The
			conversions are similar to 'pr -e';'dd cbs=80
			conv=ucase,ibm' except that the outputfile is in the
			current directory, and the 'f' option does not convert
			comment statements to uppercase. The 'f' option
			converts IRIS fortran textfiles.
	18:		'print'(hex) the most recently received message.
	19:		Close and reopen the GeometryLink card. Causes a
			Unit Check error to host computer.
	20 nnnn bb (ae): 'print'(hex) the user memory from nnnn(hex)for bb(hex)
			bytes. The menu shows the start address of user memory.
			There is no protection on the display, so you must
			be sure of the addresses and extent of display.
			The final field selects the translated display table:
			a is ascii, e is ebcdic.
	21 bb:		Write bb(hex) to the 'kb_nano' port(7eef) of the
			GeometryLink. This is the keystroke port, and it
			normally uses 3274 codes.
			Use this only under guidance from above.
	22 bb:		Write bb(hex) to the 'signal' port(7eee) of the
			GeometryLink. This is the control port, using
			the RUN and SIGx bits to control the i/f modes.
			Use this only under guidance from above.
	33:		RGL, same as menu 3 with L1 keyboard lamp for each
			receive message.
	34:		UDT, same as menu 4 with L1 keyboard lamp for each
			receive message.
	100 or higher	quit.
