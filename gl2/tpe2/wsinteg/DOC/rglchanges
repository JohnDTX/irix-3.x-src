The FORTRAN RGL for IBM mainframes is changed to reflect the reality of the
GeometryLink performance. The changes are in:
lib.f
	1. Comment out trailing cr after a returned array (which ends with a cr)
		getmatrix, readpixels, readRGB, blkqread, endfeedback.
	2. Comment out calls to echoon and echooff, as they have no use
		on the GeometryLink and I don't trust the linker/loader to 
		remove them. Echoon asnd echoff are empty routines.
	3. Change the rotate command to convert the transmitted axis from
		ebcdic to ascii before it is sent.
fio.copy
	1. Relevant values for ibm machine
io.f
	1. Extensive text conversion for ascii link.
	2. Removal of dosync on receive arrays.
	3. Extensive rotate/translate changes.
