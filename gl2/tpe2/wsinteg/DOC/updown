	This document describes file transport
	Peter Ecclesine 20 November 85 Revised 20 December 85

	Description of the Upload/Download file transfer

	The file transfer software has two components, the mainframe
	VM/CMS driver module UDT, and the iris program t3279.

	The t3279 program provides many 3270 inteface capabilities that
	are described elsewhere, and this document will only
	describe it's use for text or binary file transfer with
	the UDT module on a VM/CMS mainframe. The t3279 menu entries used
	are 19 to cause the 3274 controller to have device end status, and 
	4 or 34. Entry 4 executes 3278/9 emulation and responds to
	UDT messages. Entry 34 is the same as entry 4 in function, and it
	blinks keyboard L1 for each message received, and L2 for each
	message transmitted to UDT. This allows the operator to 
	observe the progress of the transfer. The t3279 menu displays
	the 3278 keyboard mapping used in the emulation.

	The mainframe file transfer program UDT is called with the
	following arguments:

	UDT VERB FN FT FM (LRECL XXXX

	VERB	BCMS2SGI	Binary from mainframe to IRIS
		TCMS2SGI	Text from mainframe to IRIS
		BSGI2CMS	Binary from IRIS to mainframe
		TSGI2CMS	Text from IRIS to mainframe
	FN			mainframe file name
	FT			mainframe file type
	FM			optional mainframe file mode
	(LRECL XXXX		CMS logical record length for inbound transfer
				* note FN, FT, are capital letters on iris.
				* note FN, FT have 8 characters max each

	e.g. UDT TCMS2SGI TEST FORTRAN A to send the text program
				TEST FORTRAN to the iris as TEST.FORTRAN

	UDT installation

	Have the system operator create an account with 10 cylinders of 3350
	storage (i.e. MYACOUNT). Log into MYACOUNT and have the system operator
	attach the system tape drive to you (i.e. att 521 MYACOUNT 181).
	Issue the following VM commands:
		REW 181
		TAPE LOAD * * A
		DET 181
		FLIST * * A
	This will load the distribution drivers, documents, and sample
	programs and execs. Read or print the .DOC files.

	UDT operation

	The operator of the iris types t3279, views the menu, and types 4 to
	enter 3278/9 emulation. The operator logs into the account
	with the UDT module, and attaches relevant disks used for the
	file transfers desired. The example here will copy PROFILE EXEC to
	XXX EXEC on the mainframe, then download and upload in binary, followed
	by text.

		COPY PROFILE EXEC A XXX EXEC A
		UDT BCMS2SGI XXX EXEC
		(UDT SAYS GRAF 200 DEFINED)
		#CP DISC
		dial back to the same account
		DIAL MYACOUNT
		the iris prints "file xfer complete"
		the operator types CTRL-T  CTRL-T to enter and exit 3278 test
			and have the dial connection dropped.
		the operator logs back to the same account
		LOG MYACOUNT password
		B
		B
		ERASE XXX EXEC
		UDT BSGI2CMS XXX EXEC A
		#CP DISC
		dial back to the same account
		DIAL MYACOUNT
		the iris prints "file xfer complete"
		the operator types CTRL-T  CTRL-T to enter and exit 3278 test
			and have the dial connection dropped.
		the operator logs back to the same account
		LOG MYACOUNT password
		B
		B
		FLIST XXX EXEC
		UDT TCMS2SGI XXX EXEC A
		#CP DISC
		dial back to the same account
		DIAL MYACOUNT
		the iris prints "file xfer complete"
		the operator types CTRL-T  CTRL-T to enter and exit 3278 test
			and have the dial connection dropped.
		the operator logs back to the same account
		LOG MYACOUNT password
		B
		B
		ERASE XXX EXEC
		UDT TSGI2CMS XXX EXEC A
		#CP DISC
		dial back to the same account
		DIAL MYACOUNT
		the iris prints "file xfer complete"
		the operator types CTRL-T  CTRL-T to enter and exit 3278 test
			and have the dial connection dropped.
		the operator logs back to the same account
		LOG MYACOUNT password
		B
		B
		FLIST XXX EXEC
		the XXX EXEC is the text download and upload version of
		the PROFILE EXEC. EBCDIC [ and ] will be lost in text file
		transfer.
		The TWICE EXEC performs the above transfers with just the
		CMS command TWICE.

		The important file transfer error is #2. This error means the
		UDT module on the mainframe didn't respond to an iris
		message. It usually means that the GRAF 200 device has been
		killed, and the operator must log the account off before
		attempting another transfer.
