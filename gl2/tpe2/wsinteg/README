	IBM 3270 interface code		08/05/87 release 3.6
There are 4 executibles in the directory:
	t3279	RGL and file transfer
	cutr	cuts and annotates RDDATA/WRDATA files
	hexd	enhanced od for ascii, 3274 data, or ebcdic files.
	pxdtest	a crash test of the 3270 card

The t3279 arguments are: t3279 [-dgiostz] [filename]
	d	log 3278 text displayed in pxlog (terminal emulation screens)
	g	log RGL commands as text in LOGFILE.x
	i	input is ascii RGL file (RDDATA type file)
	o	log RGL ascii as hex from/to host in RDDATA.x WRDATA.x
	s	snapshots of comm problems stored at filename
	t	use textport for 3278 emulation
	z	use gbegin for xginit, rather than ginit to save color map

The cutr arguments are: cutr -[bcmrw] inputfile [+msg_offset]
	b	create ascii CUT from binary ebcdic file (80 col records)
	c	create commlog, replacing "ef {xx xx xx}" with "{xx xx xx xx+1}"
	m	cut on 0xef (MSGDATA type file)
	r	cut on 0x10 (RDDATA type file)
	w	cut on 0x7e (WRDATA type file)
		msg_offset is decimal messages to skip before cutting
		CUT is the outputfile, numbered with LOGFILE numbers

The hexd arguments are: hexd -[aeinorw] inputfile [hex_offset]
	a	input is ascii file
	e	input is ebcdic file
	i	input is ascii (hilite 0x05, 0x10, and 0x7e)
	n	no hilite, regardless of other option
	o	input is ascii (hilite 0x05, 0x10, and 0x7e)
	r	input is RDDATA file (0x10 hilite)
	w	input is WRDATA file (0x7e hilite)
		where hex_offset is up to 4 bytes and may be expressed as:
			0x89abcdef or x89abcdef or 89abcdef

The env.csh should be sourced before performing any makes in this directory

The make file asserts DEBUG to allow these log files, but production code 
should be compiled without DEBUG, as the logging tests take time.

The following files are mainly supporting RGL, and can be ignored by an oem
interrested im message and file transfer:
bogus.c, dispatch.[ch], hostio.h, hostio3279.c, irisio3279.c, local.c, ret.c,
rpc.h, special3279.c, term.h, ttymodes.c, util.c.
