	DISCUSSION OF RGL

	SGI terminals were used to display graphically mounds of 'mainframe'
data. The workstations display mounds of self-contained/self-generated data.
Many of our richest customers/prospects are not able to contain/generate the
data on a workstation, but must retrieve it from a 'mainframe'. In many
cases, the mainframe mips are less expensive than the communications/SGI mips.
	Let us divide the work into:
		input process
		communication process
		database process
		function process (windowing, solids modeling)
		communication process
		display process
	In this model, the work is started by operator input, and is completed
by display. Some of the operator input is directed to the display, some to 
communications, some to function and database, and some to the mainframe
operating system. Some is directed to the SGI operating system. The problem
of input focus is pertinent to this aspect of RGL. Mex is an attempt to
allow interaction with several processes, and manage the 'display' process
of each one.
	A next generation RGL will recognize the 'input focus' problem, and
allow the gl parsing to be seperate from communications, database, and function
processing.
