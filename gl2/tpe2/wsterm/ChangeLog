NB. Some of these changes made it into 3.3.1.  All are in W2.4/3.4.
--------
lib.prim changes:
    - RGL FORTRAN winope() is now generated to return a value.  Before
      it wasn't.
    - strgen.awk has been changed to not do any of the name conversions 
      for the "special" routines, ie. those GL routines which for one
      reason or another can not be called directly from the dispatch
      table, except for the routines in ret.c.  The conversion is now 
      done by calling sed in the Makefiles.  This way different programs
      can have different routines be "special".
    - set{fast,slow}com() now return a Boolean telling if the communications
      medium can be put into the selected mode.  The old versions of the
      routines were kept in their spots in lib.prim and given a "zz"
      prefix in order for things to be compatible with old RGL programs.


iris/wsiris changes:
    - Code to handle getdev() in terminal emulator needed to be fixed.
    - The RGL should now recover better from failures when malloc-ing
      temporary buffers for routines which return arrays.
    - Temporary buffer malloc error message reworded slightly.
    - Test for use of localbuffer is now required_size <= sizeof localbuffer.
      Test used to be < .
    - set{fast,slow}com() now return a Boolean telling if the communications
      medium can be put into the selected mode (for the iris program, TRUE
      is always returned).  The old versions of the routines were kept and 
      given a "zz" prefix.

wsiris changes:
    - gbegin(), getport(), and winopen() now have the same special handling
      that ginit() does.  Before this change, the use of gbegin(), getport(),
      or winopen() instead of ginit() would have caused the RGL gexit() to
      be ignored.
    - Entered IP address are now checked that they contain three dots.
    - When using the window manager on the terminal, only one TCP/IP 
      wsiris will be run when /etc/hosts doesn't exist.  When run on
      the workstation, if /etc/hosts does not exist, wsiris now 
      exits instead of asking for the IRIS and host IP addresses.
    - "IP/TCP" changed to "TCP/IP" and "2300" in comments changed to
      "2300/3010".
    - The functions recs() and recb() are typed to return a short and a byte.
    - TCP/IP wsiris used to hang if a bad host IP address was entered.
      This was been fixed.
    - Error messages dealing with temporary buffer allocation and
      array transport will now display the GL command name during the
      processing of which they occur.
    - getcmdname() now always returns a valid character pointer.
    - Now possible to use serial communications in fast mode.  The serial
      line is no longer conditioned with ISTRIP (strip bit 7).  The RGL
      hasn't been changed to support fastmode, however.
    - If the -y option was given, wsiris will abort if put in fast mode.
    - New keyboard commands: ~%Dn and ~%Zn.  They toggle the -d n and -z n
      options.  ~%D3 takes the characters following it until a terminating
      <RETURN> to be a new logfile name.  The current one is closed and the
      new one opened for append.  If the <RETURN> follows immediately, 
      the current logfile name is displayed.
    - New keyboard command: ~DEL.  This reboots the IRIS after asking for
      confirmation.  SCR# 1357
    - New options:
	-d 3 filename - This sets the logfile name to filename.
	-d 5	      - writehost() will be killed when initializing
			the graphics.  This is useful when debugging
			readhost().
    - A special hack was done to log FORTRAN routines with character array
      arguments as strings instead of arrays.  The same hack is used
      to print the string argument to dbtext().
    - errorm() will now only call perror() if its type argument is a capital
      letter, eg. 'F' instead of 'f'.
    - winattach() is called upon receipt of a ginit(), gbegin(), 
      getport(), or winopen() so that the graphics window, which is always
      in the foreground, is attached to automatically.  Has no effect when 
      not running the window manager.  SCR# 1146 
    - You can now interrupt out of a connection attempt.  This means
      that you don't have to wait for the connection failure if you know
      you typed an incorrect hostname.
    - Floating-point errors are now caught using fpsigset().  A message
      is displayed and processing continues.
    - wsiris checks the return status of the call to system() which does
      the TCP/IP initialization.  If the initialization failed, it prints
      a message and exits.
    - Since the IEEE-488 devices are really only half-duplex, two of them
      are now used: one for reading and the other for writing.
    - The size of the stack frame used to execute the GL commands was
      increased to 0x3000 longs.  capture() and rcapture() require this
      much stack space.  A marker is placed in the last element of the
      stack frame before use.  An error is generated if the marker is no
      longer there after the GL routine has been executed.
    - The echo of the monitor type after a ~%M command is now correct.
    - SIGCLD is no longer used to let the parent (readhost()) know when a 
      child has died.  Instead, writehost() gives readhost() a pipe cmd
      telling it to terminate.

libgl changes:
    - In getport, gl_hintinit is now called before the test to
      see if should fork.  This is so gl_putinbackground can be
      set before it is tested.  This fixed the wsiris bug where after
      exitting there were two keyboard readers.  SCR #1344
    - The Vkernel versions of getport() and winopen() now call gbegin()
      instead of being simply null routines.
    - Added null setfastcom() and setslowcom() to local GL.  This was done
      so that remote programs which called them do not have be changed
      when compiled to run locally.  Both always return TRUE.

NB. Some of these changes made it in time for T2.4/3.4.  All made it into
    W2.5/3.5.

wsiris changes:
    - rc.tcp is now called to do the TCP initialization when there is no
      /etc/hosts.
    - errorm() wasn't recognizing the capitial letter type codes the rest
      of wsiris was callling it with.
    - isystem() now does a setuid(geteuid()) after the fork() so that
      irsh commands are executed with a real-uid of root.

wsiris changes:
    - By default, the parity bit is stripped from incoming bytes over the
      serial line.  This action is turned off when in fast mode.
