- So that wsiris can cleanly recover from GL errors which cause readhost()
  to be SIGKILL-ed, make readhost() be a child process, too.  After the
  parent forks it, it waits for any of its children to die and then calls
  cleanup(0) to kill the rest.  Add -d 4 flag which inhibit this, i.e.
  readhost() remains the parent. SCR #1514

- Add setintrchar() to RGL.  This which will sent by wsiris when it is
  killed by the window manager to interrupt the host process.  SCR #1093.

- Have wsiris indicate that the keyboard is queued.  It could do this by
  lighting lamp L1, say, when it receives qdevice(KEYBD), and extinguishing
  when it receives unqdevice(KEYBD).  SCR #1515

- Implement fastmode serial communications, at least in 4.2 and SYSTEM5
  versions.  All that's required is to put the host into raw mode, but
  with XON/XOFF enabled.  

- Remove IBM stuff from irisio.c.  Peter E. says all current and future
  IBM customers will use Geometry Link and never again serial.

- wsiris.1c: move .wsirisrc explanation to separate paragraph after the
  first one.  As it is now, -f references .wsirisrc before it is defined.

- remove set monitor cmd (~%m<n>) and add set60hz, etc to host distribution.
