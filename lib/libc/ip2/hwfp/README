This is the directory for the C runtime low-level floating point routines
for Juniper's FPA

The following conventions are observed:

	floating point registers f0 and f15, the fpa bus and
	result registers, are, of course, volatile.

	floating point registers f1..f4 are considered compiler
	temporary registers, and are volatile accross any call.
	Thus, the routines in this directory do not have to 
	save and restore f1..f4.
