		UNIX Programmer's Manual: Volume 1

This directory contains source files for the "UNIX Programmer's
Manual: Volume 1".  The different subdirectories correspond to
sections in the manual.  In the directory u_man (user's manual pages)
the divisions are:
	man1	Section 1
	man2	Section 2	System Calls
	man3	Section 3	Subroutines
	man4	Section 4	File Formats
	man5	Section 5	Miscellaneous
	man6	Section 6 	Games

In the directory a_man (adminstrator's manual pages) the divisions are:
	man1	Section 1	(suffix 1m)
	man7	Section 7	Special Files
	man8	Section 8	Administration


To print a page, find the source file
for it and use the following incantation:

	mmdoc -Tpsc manpagefilename

note: you MUST have the following in your path to print a man page:

	/pubs/5.3/bin /pubs/tools

The directory "man0" contains various Shell scripts for producing
the manual.  There is a README which explains how to use the
scripts.  "unsoft/tools" also has some scripts that may be useful.

Due to differences between the software on the IRIS 2000 Series
workstations and the IRIS Turbo Option (68020 Upgrade)/IRIS 3300, 
new manual pages for certain programs have been
generated.  The following manual pages were affected:  cc(1), df(1), as20(1),
fs(4), newfs(1m), efs(4), bellfs(4), inode(4), bellinode(4), efsinode(4),
cpp(1), ld(1).

Manual pages that apply to IRIS Turbo Option/IRIS 3300 and which also 
have a companion manual page for the 2000 series
workstation have been given the suffix j as part of the file name.

The following manual pages do not apply to the IRIS Turbo Option/IRIS 3300:
fload.1m and library.1.

NOTE: After the 2.4 release, the manual pages for ld(1) and cpp(1)
will be updated to reflect both the IRIS 2000 series and the IRIS
3000 series workstations.
