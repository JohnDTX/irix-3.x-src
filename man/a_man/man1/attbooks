Rich -

Here is the DWB scam:

We want to ship two manuals from AT&T with the LaserWriter support
option, which will be available with the 2.5/3.5 release.  This
option includes some text formatting tools and the software to drive
an Apple LaserWriter.  (It does not include the LaserWriter itself,
which must be purchased from Apple.)

We tried to get a source tape for the books from AT&T, but we couldn't
get a current version.  They sent us an old version, which was much
different and not nearly as good.  Our contact there (Ira Kistenberg,
at (800) 828-8549) seems to think that source files might not be
available.  My current tendency is to buy the printed books directly
from AT&T.  The other possibility is that we could buy from AT&T the
right to print books for our customers from either masters supplied by
AT&T or the one copy of the books that we have here.

The books are:
		Documenter's Workbench Software User's Guide,
			part number 310-004
		Documenter's Workbench Software Technical Discussion
			and Reference Manual, part number 310-005

The basic cost is $50 for each volume; 15% discount available for
large quantities.

Chris Blumenthal in our Sales group has been the main negotiator so far.
He managed to get us the tape, and he is in general quite helpful.  I'm
not sure what his role will be in the final negotiations.  He seems to
be in charge of our contracts with OEMs and suppliers.  I doubt that he
actually places orders and such.  (He must have some contact with the
people in Purchasing ? )

Oh, I'm meeting with Jake Krakauer on Monday morning to make sure it's
OK with Marketing for us to ship a book in AT&T's binder, etc.  I'll let
you know the outcome of that.

Thanks, and good luck.					-Sue
