.I Hyroute
manipulates the hyperchannel routing information.
.PP
With the
.B \-s
option, it reads

If no input file is given, or if the argument `\-' is encountered,
.I hyroute
reads from standard input.

The
.B \-c
option causes 
.I
hyroute
to compare the system's current information to
that contained in
.IR file .
.PP
The
.B \-p
option causes a digested version of
.I file
to be printed.
