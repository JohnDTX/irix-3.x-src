I am not deleting the text below as this is some conjecture on my part.  
Looks like this in the source for Version 3.0 iug gl man pages.  The file
mn has version 3.0 in it, a very good sign.

The files in this directory
are the man pages for version 2.1 of the IRIS User's Guide.

The man pages for Version 2.0 of the IUG are 
in the directory /doc/ref/gl2/arch3.

The files in the directory called "manmac"
are files used for formatting
the man pages in Version 2.0 of the
IRIS User's Guide.

To run off a man page type:
	
	xroff mn filename

if any preprocessors are used type:

	tbl mn filename | eqn | xroff

To find out if any preprocessors (that is, tbl or eqn) are used,
type:
	fgrep .TS filename
	fgrep .EQ filename

or you can go ahead and pipe the files through tbl and eqn, even if they
aren't used.
