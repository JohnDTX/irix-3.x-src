This update to the 4.1 distribution of June 1981 provides support
for the VAX 11/730, full networking and interprocess communication
support, an entirely new file system, and many other new features.
It is certainly the most ambitious release of software ever prepared
here and represents many man-years of work.
Bill Shannon (both at DEC and at Sun Microsystems)
and Robert Elz of the University
of Melbourne contributed greatly to this distribution
through new device drivers and painful debugging episodes.
Rob Gurwitz of BBN wrote the initial version of the code upon
which the current networking support is based.
Eric Allman of Britton-Lee donated countless hours to the mail system.
Bill Croft (both at SRI and Sun Microsystems) aided in the
debugging and development of the networking facilities.
Dennis Ritchie of Bell Laboratories also
contributed greatly to this distribution, providing
valuable advise and guidance.  Helge Skrivervik
worked on the device drivers which enabled
the distribution to be delivered with a TU58
console cassette and RX01 console flopppy disk, and
rewrote major portions of the standalone i/o system
to support formatting of non-DEC peripherals.
.LP
Numerous others contributed their time and energy in organizing
the user software for release, while many groups of people on
campus suffered patiently through the low spots of development.
As always, we are grateful to the UNIX user community for 
encouragement and support. 
.LP
Once again, the financial support of the Defense Advanced Research
Projects Agency is gratefully acknowledged.

This update to the fourth distribution of November 1980 provides
support for the VAX 11/750 and for the full interconnect architecture
of the VAX 11/780.  Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne contributed
greatly to this distribution especially in the boot-time system
configuration code;  Bill Shannon of DEC supplied us with the
implementation of DEC standard bad block handling.  The research
group at Bell Laboratories and DEC Merrimack provided us with access
to 11/750's in order to debug its support.
.LP
Other individuals too numerous to mention provided us with bug reports,
fixes and other enhancements which are reflected in the system.  We
are grateful to the UNIX user community for encouragement and
support.

The financial support of the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency
in support of this work is gratefully acknowledged.

This manual reflects the Berkeley system mid-October, 1980.
A large amount of tuning has been done in the system since the last release;
we hope this provides as noticeable an improvement for you as it did for us.
This release finds the system in transition; a number of facilities
have been added in experimental versions (job control, resource limits)
and the implementation of others is imminent (shared-segments, higher
performance from the file system, etc.).
Applications which use facilities that are in transition should be aware
that some of the system calls and library routines will change
in the near future.  We have tried to be conscientious and make it
very clear where this is likely.
.LP
A new group has been formed
at Berkeley, to assume responsibility for the future
development and support of a version of UNIX on the VAX.
The group has received funding from the
Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
to supply a standard version of the system to DARPA contractors.
The same version of the system will be made available to other licensees
of UNIX on the VAX for a duplication charge.
We gratefully acknowledge
the support of this contract.
.LP
We wish to acknowledge the contribution of a number of individuals to
the the system.
.LP
We would especially like to thank
Jim Kulp of IIASA,
Laxenburg Austria and his colleagues,
who first put job control facilities into UNIX;
Eric Allman, Robert Henry, Peter Kessler and Kirk McKusick, who
contributed major new pieces of software;
Mark Horton, who contributed to the improvement of facilities and
substantially improved the quality of our bit-mapped fonts,
our hardware support staff:
Bob Kridle,
Anita Hirsch,
Len Edmondson
and
Fred Archibald,
who helped us to debug a number of new peripherals;
Ken Arnold who did much of the leg-work in getting this version of the
manual prepared, and did the final editing of sections 2-6,
some special individuals within Bell Laboratories:
Greg Chesson,
Stuart Feldman,
Dick Haight,
Howard Katseff,
Brian Kernighan,
Tom London,
John Reiser,
Dennis Ritchie,
Ken Thompson,
and
Peter Weinberger
who helped out by answering questions;
our excellent local DEC field service people,
Kevin Althaus and Frank Chargois
who kept our machine running virtually all the time, and fixed it quickly
when things broke;
and,
Mike Accetta of Carnegie-Mellon University,
Robert Elz of the University of Melbourne,
George Goble of Purdue University,
and
David Kashtan of the Stanford Research Institute
for their technical advice and support.
.LP
Special thanks to Bill Munson of DEC who helped by augmenting
our computing facility
and to Eric Allman for carefully proofreading the
``last'' draft of the manual and finding the bugs which we knew were
there but couldn't see. 
.LP
We dedicate this to the memory of David Sakrison, late chairman of our
department, who gave his support to the establishment of our VAX
computing facility, and to our department as a whole.

Mark Horton who helped prepare this manual, and
Eric Allman, Bob Kridle, Juan Porcar
and Richard Tuck for their contributions to the kernel.
.LP
