.SH DESCRIPTION
.I ps630 
reads in 
.I files
(Diablo 630 format print files) and converts them to P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 format 
for printing on a P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printer.  If no
.I files
are specified, the standard input is used.  By default, the P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2
program is sent to the standard output.
.I ps630 
can convert 
.I nroff
files generated with the 
.B \-Txerox
switch.
Typewheel emulation information may be specified as options.
Font specifications (for bold and regular) are P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 font names
(e.g., Times-Roman, Times-Bold, Courier-Bold, Courier-BoldOblique).
10, 12, or 15 characters per inch may be selected.
.sp
The possible options are:
.TP
.BI \-f " bodyfont"
sets the font to be used for normal printing.
The default is Courier.
.TP
.BI \-F " boldfont"
sets the font to be used for boldface.
The default is Courier-Bold.
.TP
.BI \-s " pitch"
selects type size for printing (both the regular and bold fonts are
scaled to this size).
.I Pitch
is in characters per inch and must be one of 10, 12, or 15.
The default is 12.
.TP
.BI \-p " file"
causes the P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 file to be written to the named file rather than
the standard output.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
enscript(1), lp(1), nroff(1).

.SH BUGS
Some applications produce ``bold'' by double striking a character.
This will not appear as bold when translated into P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2.  Only the
bold produced by issuing the proper Diablo command sequence (escape-O) 
will result in bold characters.
.sp
Times-Roman and Helvetica are narrow fonts that may look squeezed if
no adjustment of page width is made by the application.
.sp
The translator uses exact positioning on the paper.  Output
from an application that has attempted to compensate for 
slippage on vertical movement may appear slightly uneven.
.sp
The following Diablo 630 commands are not supported: print suppression,
HY-Plot, extended character set, downloading print wheel information or
program mode, page lengths other than 11 inches, paper feeder control,
hammer energy control, remote diagnostic, backward printing control (note,
however, that ``reverse printing'' is supported).
