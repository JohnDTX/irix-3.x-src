and

among others) to make the best use of
.IR subj .

.SH WARNINGS
.PP
.I subj
selects sequences of capitalized words as subjects except
the first word in each sentence.  Thus,if a sentence begins
with a proper noun, the capitalization rule will not select
this word as a subject.  On the other hand, since each
sentence is expected to begin on a newline, the first word
of a sentence that begins in the middle of a line may be 
erroneously selected.
.PP
The output of 
.I subj
may not be appropriate for your needs and should be edited accordingly.
.SH BUGS
.PP
.I subj
also selects as subjects modifier-noun sequences from the abstract,
headings and topic sentences (the first sentence in each paragraph, and
occasionally a word is incorrectly categorized as a noun or adjective.
