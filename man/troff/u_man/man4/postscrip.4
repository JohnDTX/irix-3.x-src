.SH DESCRIPTION
The P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 print file format
is a programming language with powerful graphics primitives
for describing printed pages.  A growing number of
devices which print P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2
page descriptions are available.
P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printers include the Apple LaserWriter,
QMS PS-800, 1200, and 2400,
Dataproducts LZR-2665 and 2660, and Linotype Linotronic 100 and 300 
typesetters.  The T\s-2RAN\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 package of UNIX software
allows UNIX systems
access to P\s-2OST\s+2S\s-2CRIPT\s+2 printers.
