10)	postscripts (these changes have been make since Version 1.0)

	August 1, 1984: replaced cpp.1 with G. Boyd's
	version, which included an update for Pascal.
	
	August 20, 1984: moved "xsh.1" to "xx.1"
	and changed references.


11)	May 5, 1985:   robinf checked in all section 1 manpages as version
	1.0.  Man pages released with the IRIS Workstation Guide
	Series 2000 were checked in.  These changes were noted in the
	rlog file.

12)	November 1, 1985:  robinf created two new directories in man1
	to reflect the man pages differences between the 68020 and the
	68010.  Also created were a gl1 and a gl2 directory.
	Separate RCS directories were created within each of these
	subdirectories.  These are the directories that should be
	used for checking files in and out.  In the main directory,
	man1, I have made adirectory called tools.  In this directory
	are two shell scripts which can be used for checking files
	in and out.
