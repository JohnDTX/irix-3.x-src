.TH BANNER7 1
.SH NAME
banner7 \- print large banner on printer
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B banner7
[
.BI \-w n
]
message ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Banner7\^
prints a large, high quality banner on the standard output.
If the message is omitted, it prompts for and
reads one line of its standard input.
If
.B \-w
is given, the output is scrunched down from a width
of 132 to
.IR n ,
suitable for a narrow terminal.
If
.I n\^
is omitted,
it defaults to 80.
.PP
The output should be printed on a hard-copy device, up to 132 columns wide,
with no breaks between the pages.  The volume is enough that you want
a printer or a fast hardcopy terminal, but if you are patient, a
decwriter or other 300 baud terminal will do.
.SH BUGS
Several 
.SM ASCII
characters are not defined, notably 
\^<\^, \^>\^, \^[\^, \^]\^, \^\\\^, \^^\^, \^_\^, \^{\^, \^}, \||\|, 
and \^~\^.  
Also, the characters \^"\^, \^'\^, and \^&\^ are funny
looking (but in a useful way.)
.PP
The
.B \-w
option is implemented by skipping some rows and columns.
The smaller it gets, the grainier the output.
Sometimes it runs letters together.
