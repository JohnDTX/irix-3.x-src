.TH EXTCENTRY 1
.SH NAME
extcentry \- extract FORTRAN-callable entry points from a C file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B extcentry
infile outfile 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I "Extcentry"
is used to extract C functions for which FORTRAN-callable
interface routines (\f2wrappers\fP) are to be generated by the program 
.IR mkf2c (1).
.I Extcentry 
accepts as input any C file (\f2infile\fP),
and outputs (to \f2outfile\fP)
only those portions which are surrounded by the special
comments
.I /*\0CENTRY\0*/
and 
.IR /*\0ENDCENTRY\0*/ .
.PP
The first step in generating a FORTRAN-to-C interface routine is
to surround only those C functions for which entry points are to be generated
by these special comments and to run the file through 
.I extcentry.
The FORTRAN-to-C interface generator program 
.I mkf2c
can then be invoked on the resultant file to generate the 
assembly language
.I wrapper.
This is necessary since 
.I mkf2c
understands only a limited subset of the C grammar, and cannot
parse such constructs as external declarations, typedefs, and C-preprocessor
directives.
