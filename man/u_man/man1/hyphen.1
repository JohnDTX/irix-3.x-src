.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hyphen
[ \f2file(s)\f1 ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I hyphen\^
finds all the hyphenated words
ending lines in
.I file(s)\^
and prints them on the standard output.
If no arguments are given, or if
.I hyphen
encounters \-, it uses the standard input.
Thus,
.I hyphen\^
may be used as a filter.
.SH EXAMPLE

\f3nroff\f1's hyphenation in
.IR textfile(s) :
.PP

.SH "SEE ALSO"
mm(1),

troff(1).
.SH BUGS
.I hyphen\^
can't cope with hyphenated
italic
(or underlined) words;
it frequently will either miss them altogether or mishandle them.
.I hyphen
occasionally
gets confused but with no ill effects other than
spurious extra output.
