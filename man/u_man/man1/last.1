.TH LAST 1
.SH NAME
last \- indicate last logins of users and teletypes
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B last
[
name ...
] [
tty ...
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I last\^
will look back in the
.I wtmp\^
file which records all logins and logouts for information about
a user, a teletype [terminal] or any group of users and teletypes.
Arguments specify names of users or teletypes of interest.
Names of teletypes may be given fully or abbreviated.
The following two examples produce the same result:
.in +.25i
last 0
.br
last tty0
.in -.25i
If multiple arguments are given, the information which applies
to any of the arguments is printed.  For example, 
.in +.25i
last root console
.in -.25i
would list all of ``root's'' sessions as well as all sessions
on the console terminal.
.PP
.I last\^
reports the sessions of the specified users and teletypes,
most recent first, indicating start times, 
duration, and teletype for each. 
If the session is still continuing or was cut short by a reboot,
.I last\^
so indicates.
.SH EXAMPLE
.IP
last reboot
.PP
will give an indication of mean time between reboots of the system.
.PP
.I last\^
with no arguments prints a record of all logins and logouts, in
reverse order.
Since
.I last\^
can generate a great deal of output, piping it through 
.IR more\^ (1) 
for screen viewing is advised.
.PP
If
.I last\^
is interrupted with a \s-2BREAK\s0, 
it indicates how far the search has progressed
in
.IR wtmp .
If interrupted with a quit signal
(generated by a \s-2CTRL\-\e\s0),
.I last\^
exits and dumps core.
.PP
\s-2CTRL\-d\s0 (EOF) signal does nothing.
Therefore exit gracefully from
.I last\^
with a \s-2BREAK\s0 or \s-2SHIFT\-DELETE\s0 signal.
