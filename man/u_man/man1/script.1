This program is useful when using a crt and a hard-copy
record of the dialogue is desired, as for a student handing
in a program that was developed on a crt when hard-copy
terminals are in short supply.
.SH BUGS
.I Script
places 
.B everything
in the log file, including
.I vi
sessions.
This is not what the naive user expects.
