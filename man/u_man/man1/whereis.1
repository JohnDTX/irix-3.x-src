.TH WHEREIS 1
.SH NAME
whereis \- locate source, binary, and or manual for program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B whereis
[
.B \-sbm

.B \-u

.B \-SBM
dir ...
.B \-f
] name ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Whereis
locates source/binary and manuals sections for specified files.
The supplied names are first stripped of leading pathname components
and any (single) trailing extension of the form ``.ext'', e.g. ``.c''.
Prefixes of ``s.'' resulting from use of source code control are also
dealt with.
.I Whereis
then attempts to locate the desired program in a list of standard places.
If any of the
.B \-b,
.B \-s
or
.B \-m
flags are given then
.I whereis
searches only for binaries, sources or manual sections respectively
(or any two thereof).
The
.B \-u
flag may be used to search for unusual entries.
A file is said to be unusual if it does not have one entry of
each requested type.
Thus ``whereis -m -u *'' asks for those files in the current
directory which have no documentation.
.sp
Finally, the
.B \-B ,
.B \-M ,
and
.B \-S
flags may be used to change or otherwise limit the places where
.I whereis
searches.
The
.B \-f
file flags is used to terminate the last such directory list
and signal the start of file names.

.SH BUGS
Since the program uses
.IR chdir (2)
to run faster, pathnames given with the
.B \-M
.B \-S
and
.B \-B
must be full; i.e. they must begin with a ``/''.
