.SH NAME
gethostid, sethostid \- get/set unique identifier of current host
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.ft B
hostid = gethostid()
long hostid;
.PP
.ft B
sethostid(hostid)
long hostid;
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sethostid
establishes a 32-bit identifier for the
current processor that is intended to be unique among all
UNIX systems in existence.  This is normally a DARPA Internet
address for the local machine.  This call is allowed only to the
super-user and is normally performed at boot time.
.PP
.I Gethostid
returns the 32-bit identifier for the current processor.
.SH NOTE
The primitives documented on this manual page
are system calls, but unlike most system calls
they are not resolved by libc.
To compile and link a program that makes these calls,
follow the procedures for section (3B) routines as
described in
.IR intro (3).
.SH SEE ALSO
hostid(1), gethostname(2)
.SH BUGS
32 bits for the identifier is too small.
