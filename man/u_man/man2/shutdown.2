call causes all or part of a full-duplex connection on
the socket associated with

to be shut down.
If \f2how\fP is 0, then further receives will be disallowed.
If \f2how\fP is 1, then further sends will be disallowed.
If \f2how\fP is 2, then further sends and receives will be disallowed.

.TP 15
[EBADF]
.I S
is not a valid descriptor.

.SH NOTE
The primitives documented on this manual page
are system calls, but unlike most system calls
they are not resolved by libc.
To compile and link a program that makes these calls,
follow the procedures for section (3B) routines as
described in
.IR intro (3).
