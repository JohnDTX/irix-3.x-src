8) robinf:	November 2, 1985.  Created 2 new directories: gl1 and gl2
		Put graphics library manual pages in these directories.
		Also removed a directory called man3.gl2.del. The files
		in this directory were moved to the iug directory in a
		subdirectory called beta because I think these are the
		beta release of the IUG (Version 2.0) manual pages. 

		In the gl1 and gl2 subdirectories, I created RCS directories
		and checked in all the files in these directories.  These
		are the RCS directories that should be used for checking
		the files in and out.

		I also created a directory called tools.  This directory
		contains two shell scripts that can be used for checking
		files in and out.
