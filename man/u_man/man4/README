RobinF.  The following manual pages were added to represent the file systems
which are available on the IRIS 3400:

	inode.4,fs.4		gives the generic information for both
				the new and old file systems.
	bellinode.4,bellfs.4	gives information that is specific to
				the Bell file system
	efsinode.4,efs.4	gives information specific to the new file
				system

Both file systems are supported on the 3400.

November 2, 1985.  Robinf created a directory called tools.  In this directory
are tools which can be used to check files in and out of the RCS directory.
