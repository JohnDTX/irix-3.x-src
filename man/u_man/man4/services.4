the known services available in the DARPA Internet.
For each service a single line should be present
with the following information:

.ns
.HP 10

.br
.ns
.HP 10
aliases
.PP
Items are separated by any number of blanks and/or
tab characters.  The port number and protocol name
are considered a single 
.IR item ;
a ``/'' is used to
separate the port and protocol (e.g. ``512/tcp'').
A ``#'' indicates the beginning of
a comment; characters up to the end of the line are
not interpreted by routines which search the file.
.PP
Service names may contain any printable
character other than a field delimiter, newline,
or comment character.
