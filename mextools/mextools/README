	    images - some images that can be pasted to the screen 
	    imglib - a library for reading and writing images
	    imgtools - a few simple tools for dealing with images
	    include - files defining image files and the colormap
	    mexrcs - a .mexrc file
	    portlib - a utility library
	    tools - a collection of tools that use the window manager

	You probably should put mextools/imgtools and mextools/tools
	in your path to make it easier to get at these goodies. . .
	in c-shell you will type something like:

	% set path=( /usr/people/gifts/mextools/imgtools \
					/usr/people/gifts/mextools/tools $path)

	Here is an exercise:

	    0. first do a make in this directory, /usr/people/gifts/mextools, 
	            and wait for it to finish. "% make". 

	    1. copy mexrcs/tools.mexrc ~/.mexrc .  This file is used by
	    	    mex when it starts up, otherwise it uses the init file
		    /usr/lib/gl2/mexrc.  

	    2. cd into tools and run startup: "% cd tools" and then "% startup".
	    	    This script starts the window manager, maps a bunch of
		    colors, and starts a program to draw the background.
		    This will take a few seconds.  

	    3. now try showmap - you gotta use the right mouse button to sweep 
		    out a region after the cursor becomes a corner. Hold the 
		    button down, move the mouse and release the button. This 
		    program displays the colors in the colormap.

	    4. try clock - this is a simple desk clock.

	    5. now try to move and resize the clock using the right
		    mouse button.

	    6. try cedit - select it for input and use the left button
		    to pick a color to edit, and move the sliders.

	    7. try mag - select it for input and use the left button
		    to pick a region of the screen to magnify. See if
		    you can figure out how to make it magnify by
		    a factor 5 instead of 2.

	    8. ok, now look at all the source in this whole tree and try
		    figure out how it works. 

	    9. the file "~/.mexrc" describes to the window manager which
		    color indexes to use for the border and the title
		    bar etc. Notice that the startup script runs makemap.
		    Makemap maps these indexes to be resonable colors.
		    If you are a curious sort you can take a look at
		    ~/.mexrc .  If things look strange when you start the 
		    window manager without using the "startup" script, as
		    in "% mex", this is only because some of the color indexes
		    listed in ~/.mexrc are not maped. You can deal with this
		    probelem by always starting the window manager with the
		    startup script, or editing your ~/.mexrc file.

	    10. the default mexrc file is set up so that if you are attached
		    to the background, you can use the left mouse button to 
		    pop the window you are pointing at, and use the middle
		    button to move windows around on the screen.  If you
		    click down in a corner of a window, you can resize quickly
		    also. good luck.


The makefiles contain a few defines that select differing parts of
include files. These are:  -DUNIX and -DIP2 or -DPM2

UNIX is because this is a unix based system (we also make a V kernel
	based terminal)
IP2 and PM2 are the 68020 and 68010 cpu boards.
