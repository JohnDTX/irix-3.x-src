 * The file system is made out of blocks of at most MAXBSIZE units,
 * with smaller units (fragments) only in the last direct block.
 * MAXBSIZE primarily determines the size of buffers in the buffer
 * pool. It may be made larger without any effect on existing
 * file systems; however making it smaller make make some file
 * systems unmountable.
 *
 * Note that the blocked devices are assumed to have DEV_BSIZE
 * "sectors" and that fragments must be some multiple of this size.
 * Block devices are read in BLKDEV_IOSIZE units. This number must
 * be a power of two and in the range of
 *	DEV_BSIZE <= BLKDEV_IOSIZE <= MAXBSIZE
 * This size has no effect upon the file system, but is usually set
 * to the block size of the root file system, so as to maximize the
 * speed of ``fsck''.
