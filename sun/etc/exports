#
# NFS exported filesystem database (see EXPORTS(4) for more information).
#
# Entries in this file consist of lines containing the following fields:
#
# filesystem	[ netgroup ] [ hostname ] [ options ] ...
#
# Filesystem must be left-justified and should name the directory on which
# a local filesystem is mounted.  Lines beginning with white space continue
# the previous line's entry.
#
# Netgroup(4) and hostname refer to machines or collections of machines to
# which filesystem is exported.
#
# Options begin with a hyphen and concatenate with comma.  Valid options
# include the following:
#	ro		readonly export
#	rw		read/write export
#	rootid=id	client uid 0 becomes id in filesystem
#	hide		filesystem is not visible to clients from superior
#			exported filesystem
#	nohide		filesystem is visible to clients from exported
#			parent filesystem
# The default options are:
#	-rw,rootid=nobody,hide
#
# Some example entries:
#	/	-ro
#	/cad	-rw,rootid=guest	cadusers cadsrc
#	/usr	-ro,nohide
#
# A system having such exports would permit clients to mount / and see
# all files in /usr, because of the nohide option.  Clients mounting /
# could not see any files in /cad, however, because hide is the default.
# Only a client belonging to the netgroup cadusers, or the client named
# cadsrc, may mount /cad.  Clients could write on /cad via NFS, but not
# on / or /usr.
