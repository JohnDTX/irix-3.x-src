# Revision 1.8  86/05/28  20:13:58  vjs
# conf/RCS created, and c-depend.{sh,awk} placed into it.  new makefile.ipII
# and makefile.pmII were also installed, but since rcs did not like their
# names, they did not get rcs'ed.
# 
# several streams modules and win.c were installed.  The most important
# change was for more window scrolling smoothness.
# 
# Revision 1.7  86/05/23  19:23:46  vjs
# changed streamio.c for ATT spl() brain damage

# Updated ipII/autoconf.c and pmII/autoconf.c to no longer check for
# the controllers mi being defined.  This WAS done to support the
# dsd which had more than one controller on the interface.  Instead, the
# dsd driver is now really two drivers, with two autoconf entries
# required.
