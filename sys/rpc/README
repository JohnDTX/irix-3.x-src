A guide to the SGI port of SUN rpc.

The following modules should track Sun source exactly except for
filename shorthands (`"' means the name is the same as Sun).

SUN		SGI
auth_none.c	"
auth_unix.h	"
clnt.h		"
clnt_raw.c	"
clnt_tcp.c	"
clnt_udp.c	"
pmap_clnt.c	"
pmap_clnt.h	"
pmap_getmaps.c	pmap_gmaps.c
pmap_getport.c	pmap_gport.c
pmap_prot.c	"
pmap_prot.h	"
rpc.h		"
rpc_msg.h	"
rpc_prot.c	"
svc.h		"
svc_auth.h	"
svc_raw.c	"
svc_simple.c	svc_simp.c
svc_tcp.c	"
svc_udp.c	"
xdr.c		"
xdr.h		"
xdr_array.c	"
xdr_float.c	"
xdr_mem.c	"
xdr_rec.c	"
xdr_reference.c	xdr_refer.c
xdr_stdio.c	"

The following contain changes from Sun source bracketed by #ifdef sgi
#endif directives.  Occasionally a misspelling in a comment or
diagnostic message was corrected without being conditionally compiled
for sgi only.  Also a few implicit ``auto'' storage class variables
were converted to ``register''.

This module contains struct member name changes for the sake of clarity
and of the maintainer's sanity.  It will therefore differ greatly but
cosmetically from Sun source.

xdr_mbuf.c	"
