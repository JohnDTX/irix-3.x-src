Steve Nelson, Unisoft, made the following changes to accounting:
	(10/11/83)
1. Changed runacct.sh to check if /usr is not
	a separately mountable file system before checking if
	there are not enough blocks to run accounting. If no mountable /usr,
	then check for space in /.
2. Same changes were made to ckpacct.sh
3. In runacct.sh in two places where a bourne shell for construct
	used a wild card * to expand to filenames, no check was
	made for files not existing, in which case for loop runs
	exactly once with parameter expanded to filename with literal "*"
	in it.  A check is now made for a case of name with literal "*".
