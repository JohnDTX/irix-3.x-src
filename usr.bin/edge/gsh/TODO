o fix -I flag to work and to correctly define a rows,cols window centered
  before iconizing, so that unshrinking works right

o Change "previous" menu entry to record origins as well as sizes

o Dave Ciemo wants a "-n" flag for don't attach

o Fix winlogin() to print a nicer message when gsh is not setuid - like change
  the main code to detect it, and avoid the login in that case, after printing
  a friendly message

o Fix to not run the movie if -I is used

o Fix up the movie to get done about 4 times faster (take at most 1 second)

o Fix the gl to have a "caps" key button that can be getbutton'd

o its nice that gsh changes the input focus.  However, it does it rather
  late.  If I clone a window, and then while it is thinking about coloring
  it and so forth, go back and try to activate the original window, I get
  zapped.  Csh finally gets thru my .login, and gsh then changes the
  focus out from under the window I'm now trying to use. (from vjs)
