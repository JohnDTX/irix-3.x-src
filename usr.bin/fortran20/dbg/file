Greg, I'm spending the week on the hotline.  I got a call about
Pascal on GL2-W2.3, and I'm stumped.  The customer is trying to
compile the test program which is found in the Pascal Release Notes,
but it doesn't compile.  Specifically, the program gets errors on
the #include <pglmacs.h> line.  The # sign is undefined.  The 
pglconsts.h, pgltypes.h, pglmacs.h, pglprocs.h files are not anywhere
to be found.  I also have some notes which Mietta used to help
some Swedish customers a few weeks back.  These notes consist of a 
README, an assembler file, several .h files, and a test program.
My questions are:

1)  Is there any chance that these programs will work or is it totally
hopeless?
2)  Do customers get these .h files with the Pascal option?  He has
all the documentation but seemingly none of the .h files.  Does he
have to write his own .h files?
