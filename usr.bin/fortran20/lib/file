Just some notes and highlights.

1. The meeting was pretty boring.  Nothing was said that wasn't in their
   documentation.

2. They are still finessing some of the hard issues - "open" file
   semantics using their lingo; fully diskless workstations (no nd device);
   etc.

3. The pyramid folks took a year and 3 months to complete their nfs, including
   beta site time.  They are just now beta-ing it, and plan on a formal release
   in january.

4. The mt. xinu people claim that it is an easy job of putting the nfs code
   into a vanilla 4.2 (which we have on the vaxen).  In many cases, they
   said, the sun guys had fixed bugs in 4.2 differently; in most cases they
   chose the sun fix over their own...

5. Everyone involved stressed that it would be more work to get it into a
   System V.  Also, in all cases, they stressed that some of the semantics
   of System V would be lost.

6. On the good side, some of their design decisions merit serious review,
   as they solve several tough problems in a quick manner.  Their usage
   of the ``lookup'' operator makes remote non-unix filesystems appear
   as a unix filesystem to the client.  This approach also solves the
   ".." problem that most remote filesystems face.  Etc.

Come by and chat for more stuff...
