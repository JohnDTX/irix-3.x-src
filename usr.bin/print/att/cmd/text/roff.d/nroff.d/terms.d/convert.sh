# This shell script will attempt to convert an old-style nroff terminal
# description file to a new-style nroff terminal table.
# 
# To use this script, make a copy of the complete (i.e. all #include lines
# expanded) C source file for the description of a terminal (say "mytty"),
# and make the filename the same as the terminal name (mytty).
# N.B.  If you use /lib/cpp to expand the #include lines, be sure to use the
# "-C" and "-P" options.
# 
# 		sh convert.sh mytty
# 
# will produce the discardable files mytty.h, mytty.1, mytty.2 and mytty.3,
# as well as the final output file tab.mytty.  The file should be examined
# for errors (and corrected), even in the absence of any "XXX...XXX" error
# lines from the conversion script.
# 
# The first section creates the first 25 items in the terminal table
# by removing the comment indicators from the old identifications, and
# by substituting numbers for values calculated using "#define INCH 240".
