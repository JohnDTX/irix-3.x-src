The files in this directory are only read by daps when it encounters
an error in trying to print a character. For example if we're trying
to print character Lb in size 36 the routines in build.c first look
for file Lb.36 and then for Lb. If neither exists daps considers it
an error and quits. This stuff was added to daps and the font directories
so the new logo could be processed as a single character. We were told
by Autologic that even if the new logos occupied more than one character
position all the pieces would be pulled in and printed when the first
position was printed. Well it just didn't work that way so I added this
stuff as a temporary way around the problem.

Use of these tables really depends on the fact that daps and troff
read different tables. Troff considers the characters legal and will
put out instructions to print them, but daps won't find them in the
font tables that it's using which causes the special routines in
build.c to look in this directory.

N.B.  The logo files in this directory are included in
this release only as examples.
