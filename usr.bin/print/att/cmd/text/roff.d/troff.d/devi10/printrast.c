/*
 *
 * Reads the raster files listed as arguments and prints the glyphs, along
 * with information about character widths and glyph numbers, on an Imagen
 * printer. The output is written in Impress. If no glyphs are selected by
 * using the -o option the entire file or files will be printed. An Impress
 * document header is the first thing written to the output file provided
 * want_header == TRUE. Use the -H option to force the header. The target
 * printer is assumed to have a resolution of res dots per inch, which by
 * default is set to RAST_RES (probably 300). If that's not the case use
 * the -r option to select a new resolution. It's really only important
 * in determining the pixel length of a page.
 *
 * Text in the printout is written using font *font in size list_size.
 * By default it's resident font cour10. You can change the requested font
 * and size using the -f and -s options respectively.
 *
 * All the raster files are assumed to be in directory *rastdir, which by
 * default is set to ".". *rastdir can be changed by using the -R option.
 * but in all cases the string "*rastdir/" is prepended to the raster file
 * names to get the complete pathname.
 *
 * As an example the command line,
 *
 *	printrast -R /usr/lib/raster/rasti300 -H -r 300 R.10 I.10 >xxx
 *
 * will write the Impress commands needed to print the glyphs in raster
 * file /usr/lib/raster/rasti300/R.10 and /usr/lib/raster/rasti300/I.10 out
 * to file xxx. The target printer is assumed to have a resolution of 300
 * dots per inch. The output file xxx begins with a document header defining
 * the language to be Impress and can therefore be set directly to an 8/300.
 *
 * A word of warning is in order here. Because I've written readrastfile()
 * so it accepts two different raster file naming conventions there isn't
 * a one to one mapping of file names to font name, size pairs. That means
 * if you have two similiarly named raster files, differing only in the
 * naming convention used, and you keep them in the same directory you'll
 * always display glyphs from the preferred file no matter which file
 * you list on the command line. I don't think it will cause any real
 * problems so I'm not going to change any of this stuff.
