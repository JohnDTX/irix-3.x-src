 * Some definitions and structure declarations used to manage the raster
 * tables supplied by Imagen.
 *
 * I've changed things a little from the way the raster tables were
 * handled in di10. No RASTERLIST file is needed or even used. The
 * troff post-processor assumes every font can be printed in all the
 * sizes listed in the DESC file. That wouldn't have been a realistic
 * assumption for the old raster tables, but it's probably pretty
 * good for the one's Imagen supplies. Anyway even if there are a
 * few missing files we can always link them to ones we really want
 * to use. While that may be a little less efficient, at least in terms
 * of downloading glyphs and memory usage on the printer, I don't think
 * it will be too bad as long as the raster files are fairly complete.
 *
 * Impress (version 1.9) restricts the families that we can define to
 * the range 0 to 95. MAXFAMILY is the upper limit of the range and
 * should not be changed unless this limit is removed. Family members are
 * also restricted and must lie between 0 and 127. Don't ever change the
 * value of MAXMEMBER as defined below.
 *
 */


#define MAXFAMILY	95		/* most families we can ever use */
#define MAXMEMBER	127		/* largest member in any family */


/*
 *
 * L_FNAME is the maximum length of the font name string stored in
 * in field name[] below. It probably should agree with the size of
 * array namefont[] as defined in troff'd dev.h structure.
 *
 */


#define L_FNAME		10		/* longest allowed font name */


/*
 *
 * The rastdata structure is used to keep track of which raster files
 * have already been read into memory. If rst isn't NULL then we assume
 * it points to a block of memory containing the raster file *name.size.
 * Note that *name probably won't be the name of the font troff is using,
 * but rather it's the name of the raster file that we want to use.
 * It's filled in from the namefont[] string stored in the appropriate
 * binary font file - at least that's the way it will be done in the
 * troff post-processor. That being the case we need to make sure that
 * L_FNAME and the size of namefont[] as defined in dev.h agree.

/*
 *
 * Imagen's raster file format is described in the Imprint-10 Programmer's
 * Manual that I got with our original printer (back in 1982). Although
 * that described a Version 0 system it's the best info I've got right
 * now so that's what I'll use.
 *
 * The raster files all contain 4 sections called the file mark, the
 * preamble, the glyph directory, and the raster data section. We're
 * really only concerned with the last 3. The preamble describes some
 * general information about the font. One of the most important
 * fields, at least the way I've written things, is the pointer to
 * the glyph directory. It begins at offset 11 and is 3 bytes long.
 * That's what we'll use to get to the glyph directory, which contains
 * specific data about each of the characters represented in the
 * raster file. Each entry in the glyph directory is 15 bytes long.
 * Knowing the number of the character that we want to print and the
 * pointer to the start of the glyph directory lets us locate that
 * character's entry in the glyph directory. The raster data section
 * starts at the end of the glyph directory and contains the bitmaps
 * used to print the characters represented in the file. Each character's
 * entry in the glyph directory has a pointer to the start of it's
 * bitmap in the raster data section, along with enough other data
 * so we can figure out where the bitmap ends.
 *
 * To use Imagen's raster files we need to be able locate a particular
 * field and then decode it. That means we need to be able to get the
 * field's offset from the beginning of the file and then determine how
 * many bytes are used by the field. The main tool I'll be using is a
 * structure called Rst (defined below). There will be one associated
 * data structure for the preamble and the glyph directory. The declaration
 * and initialization of these Rst arrays is handled in file rast.c
 * using the definitions given here.
 *
 * I'll begin by giving the Rst structure and a few other associated
 * definitions. The definitions are used to classify field types, while the
 * the Rst structure is designed to enable us to pick fields out of a given
 * raster file once it's been read into memory. size is the size in bytes
 * of each field, offset is where it starts, usually relative to the
 * beginning of the raster file. If glyphdir is TRUE then the field is
 * in the glyph directory and we'll need to add in the directory's offset
 * before we get to the right place. type describes the field and allows
 * us to decode it properly. Most fields will be unsigned, although glyph
 * reference points are signed integers. strings are a little tougher but
 * we really don't need them, at least not right now, so I'll ignore them.
 * They're all variable length and are only found in the preamble. They
 * could be handled by letting offset field point to the first string and
 * the size field be the number of strings that preceed the one we're
 * looking for. Imagen encodes strings a little differently than we're
 * used to. They're not terminated by '\0', but rather the first byte
 * in each string gives the number of bytes in the rest of the string.
 *

 * first set, ie. the ones beginning with the characters P_ are
 * indices into the Rst array rst[] (defined in rast.c), where we can
 * locate size and offset information about a particular field. There's
 * really no need to ever change any of this stuff - all it has to do is
 * agree with the way RST_INIT is defined. RST_INIT is used in rast.c
