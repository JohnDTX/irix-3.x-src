 * Control strings used by the post-processor when it is building up
 * characters. The format of the strings is, an optional motion followed
 * by a character that we want to print. The ordered pair (dx,dy) defines
 * a motion. dx and dy specify relative horizontal and vertical movements
 * in terms of a percentage of the width of the character we are trying to
 * build up. Both dx and dy must be integers. If you decide to change this
 * syntax, routine dostring() will have to be rewritten.
