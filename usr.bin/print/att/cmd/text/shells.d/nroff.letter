I would like to be considered for the position of Document Production Coordinator
with Business Computer Systems, Inc.
I have a B.A. in English and have finished course work for a Masters in English.
Currently, I am assisting Steve Foley, Production Editor with Techno-Publishing 
in Jonesville.
My duties consist of proofreading documents and coordinating graphics production.

While I enjoy my position here, I know I am ready for more challenging work and 
greater responsibility.
Our shop uses a computer running UNIX System V.  
I am confident in my potential for growth with the Technical Writing Staff 
at Business Computer Systems.
I have enclosed my resume and two letters of recommendation.
Please feel free to contact my present supervisor with any questions you may have.
I am available for an interview at any time, and I look forward to hearing from you.
