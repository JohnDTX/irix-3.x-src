However sophisticated your printer is, \fItroff\fR can probably handle your font control.
By placing .ft on a line by itself before the line of text you want to change
or \ef before the word or words you want to change, you can modify your typography.
.ft I
This is a line of italic made with .ft I (italic).
.br
.ft B
If you prefer a heavier emphasis, use bold roman type made with .ft B (bold).
.br
.ft H
For the clean appearance of a sans serif type, use .ft H (Helvetica).
.br
.ft R
Roman is the most popular, of course.
.P
The \ef allows for a finer level of control:
The individual \fIitalic\fR, \fBbold\fR, or \fHHelvetica\fR word can be done in-line.
.P
All printers were not created equal, so consult your systems manager to find what is
available.
