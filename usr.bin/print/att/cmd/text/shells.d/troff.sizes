\s36The Size \s10of characters is useful for emphasis
or for meeting special reading needs such as making posters or aiding those with poor eyesight.
The range of \fIpoint sizes\fR at a \fItroff\fR user's disposal is potentially quite broad.
The actual limits in each case, though, are imposed by the individual printer
supporting a UNIX system.
Like control of typeface, or font, you can control size both before and in the middle of a line.
The modification of character size also requires that we keep an eye on the size of
vertical space between lines of text.
\fItroff\fR, characteristically, puts the control in your hands:
.sp 1
.ps 12
.vs 14
This request is for a point size of 12 and should be followed by a vertical space of 14.
.ps 14
.vs 16
A jump to 14, though, is quite a bit larger.  That means our text will look best with a vertical space of 16.
\&\fI.vs\fR enables you to space these lines of large type without fear of overlapping characters.
.ps 22
.vs 24
We can also change size on a word-by-word basis like this:
Whether you want \s10ten \s12twelve \s14fourteen \s16sixteen or \s20twenty,
an in-line command will do anything a before-the-line command will do.
\s10Don't forget to return to ten point unless you want all the rest of your text in
twenty point.
