The files in this directory are examples from Adobe's
PostScript Language Cookbook -- not quite the version 
in the blue Addison-Wesley book.  They are fun
examples of the things you can do with PostScript.

These files are not necessary for the proper operation of
TranScript, and may be deleted if disk space is scarce.
