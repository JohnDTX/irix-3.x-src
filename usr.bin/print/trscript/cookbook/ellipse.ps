    /yrad exch def                          % procedure takes six operands:
    /xrad exch def                          % the x and y coordinates of the
    /y exch def                             % center of the ellipse (the
    /x exch def                             % center is defined as the point
					    % of intersection of the major and
					    % minor axes), the ``radius'' of
					    % the ellipse in the x direction,
					    % the ``radius'' of the ellipse in
					    % the y direction, the starting
					    % angle of the elliptical arc and
					    % the ending angle of the
					    % elliptical arc.
							     
					    % The basic strategy used in
					    % drawing the ellipse is to
					    % translate to the center of the
					    % ellipse, scale the user
					    % coordinate system by the x and y
					    % radius values, and then add a
					    % circular arc, centered at the
					    % origin with a 1 unit radius to
					    % the current path. We will be
					    % transforming the user coordinate
					    % system with the translate and
					    % rotate operators to add the
					    % elliptical arc segment but we
					    % don't want these transformations
					    % to affect other parts of the
					    % program. In other words, we
					    % would like to localize the
					    % effect of the transformations.
					    % Usually the gsave and grestore
					    % operators would be ideal
					    % candidates for this task.
					    % Unfortunately gsave and grestore
					    % are inappropriate for this
					    % situation because we cannot save
					    % the arc segment that we have
					    % added to the path. Instead we
					    % will localize the effect of the
					    % transformations by saving the
					    % current transformation matrix
					    % and restoring it explicitly
					    % after we have added the
					    % elliptical arc to the path.
