/smallfont                                  % For efficiency reasons, programs
  /Times-Roman findfont 9 scalefont def     % that use several different
/normalfont                                 % typefaces in different sizes
  /Times-Roman findfont 12 scalefont def    % will typically "define" the
/largefont                                  % fonts that are to be used at the
  /Times-Roman findfont 18 scalefont def    % beginning of the program. These
/italicfont                                 % "defined" fonts are then used
  /Times-Italic findfont 12 scalefont def   % later throughout the program in
/boldfont                                   % setfont operations. By defining
  /Times-Bold findfont 12 scalefont def     % the fonts at the outset, we save
					    % time later by not having to
					    % perform findfind-scalefont
					    % operations each time a setfont
					    % is done. Here we are setting up
					    % several face and size
					    % combinations with
					    % findfont-scalefont sequences.
					    % The resulting font dictionaries
					    % are assigned to suitably named
					    % variables. The variable names
					    % have been chosen to be as
					    % descriptive as possible yet
					    % actually we could have chosen
					    % any names that adhere to the
					    % PostScript name syntax. We will
					    % later use these variables with
					    % the setfont operator.
