					    % what they are). When the
					    % findfont operator has been
					    % executed, it pushes a
					    % dictionary, called a ``font
					    % dictionary,'' onto the operand
					    % stack. This font dictionary
					    % contains the information
					    % required by PostScript to
					    % construct characters in the font

(Theodore Low De Vinne) show                % the desired point size. Although
					    % this could be accomplished by
showpage                                    % using the scale operator, it may
					    % be inconvenient since it will
					    % scale everything including the
					    % coordinates to be used for
					    % placement of characters on the
					    % page. The scalefont operator
					    % scales only the characters in
					    % the font. scalefont takes a font
					    % dictionary (the one left on the
					    % stack by the findfont operator)
					    % and a number which is used to
					    % scale the font. The scalefont
					    % operator pushes a new font
					    % dictionary that contains the
					    % proper scaling information in
					    % addition to all the other font
					    % dictionary information onto the
					    % operand stack.
							    
					    % When PostScript "draws" text
					    % onto the page, it uses the
					    % "current font." The current font
					    % is set using the setfont
					    % operator. setfont takes a font
					    % dictionary (in this case the
					    % result of the findfont-scalefont
					    % operations) as its argument.
									  
					    % Finally we wish to draw text on
					    % the page. This last step has two
					    % parts to it: positioning the
					    % text on the page and indicating
					    % which characters are to be drawn
					    % at that position. Positioning
					    % the text is accomplished by
					    % using the moveto operator.
					    % Indicating which characters are
					    % to be drawn is accomplished by
					    % using the show operator. The
					    % show operator takes a string as
					    % its argument. The origin of the
					    % first character in the string is
					    % placed at the current point and
					    % then the current point is
					    % shifted by the width of the
					    % character. (This is the reason
					    % for the moveto operation - it
					    % sets the current point). This
					    % process is repeated for each
					    % character in the string, and
					    % when finished, show will leave
					    % the current point positioned
					    % after the last character drawn.
					    % Each new line of text to be
					    % printed must be repositioned
					    % using the moveto operator.
