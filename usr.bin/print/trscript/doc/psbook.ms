The

\*(PS Language Reference Manual

is the complete definitive reference guide to the \*(PS language.
It begins with a discussion of the basic ideas
that underlie \*(PS, followed by comprehensive presentations of
the language and its graphics and font facilities.  The precise
semantics of every \*(PS operator is detailed in a convenient
dictionary-like format.  The manual concludes with four useful
appendices on the standard fonts, implementation limits, structuring
conventions, and the Apple LaserWriter.

The
.I
\*(PS Language Tutorial and Cookbook
.R
provides a thorough, clearly written guide to \*(PS
that outlines the features and capabilities of the language and
shows practical ways to create useful \*(PS programs.  Using
numerous annotated examples and short programs, the tutorial
provides a step-by-step guided tour of \*(PS, highlighting
those qualities that make it such a unique and powerful language.
The cookbook offers a collection of some of the most useful
techniques and procedures available to \*(PS programmers.
