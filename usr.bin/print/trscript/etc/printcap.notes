#
# Notes on printcap entry for a PostScript printer
# driven by TranScript software over an rs232 tty line.
#
# See the printcap(5) in the UNIX manual for more information
# about the structure and contents of the file /etc/printcap.
#
# At least one PostScript printer in the database should
# have the alias "PostScript", as this will be the default
# printer for users without the PRINTER environment variable
# set (on the conservative assumption that the default printer
# at an installation will not be a PostScript printer).
# When TranScript software uses this default, it will send
# to the FIRST printer in the printcap file with the alias
# PostScript.
#
# If you desire, you may edit /etc/printcap to reflect the following options.
#
# To turn off printer accounting, remove the "af" entry.
#
# To turn off banner logging and/or banner string printing in the 
# log file, add an "sh" entry.
#
# To discard all logging (NOT recommended) change the
# "lf" entry to "lf=/dev/null".
#
# Do NOT add an "st" entry (for anything by "st=status") as
# the pscomm program expects to report status there.
#
# The stty bits specified below are:
# fs == set flag bits	== CBREAK|TANDEM
# fc == clear flag bits	== EVENP|ODDP|RAW|CRMOD|ECHO|LCASE
# xs == set mode bits	== LDECCTQ|LLITOUT
# xc == clear mode bits == --

# Here is an entry for a networked printer.
# Accounting (if done) is done at the remote machine.
#
# You must create a local spooling directory.
# The local log file gets used only if something is seriously
# wrong for the local line printer daemon.  Otherwise, all normal
# spooling messages go in the remote log file (i.e., on the host 
# with the printer).
# 
# All translation via printcap entries (e.g. gf) takes place on
# the remote machine (the machine with the printer attached).
# No filters are specified for networked printers.
#
# Note that it may be necessary to add this host to the remote
# host's /.rhosts file of "trusted" hosts, in order for certain
# remote commands (e.g., lprm) to work.
