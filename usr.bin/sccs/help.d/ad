You supplied a 'd' keyletter to delete the flag named, but you
followed the flag with a value. This is not allowed.
-13
"value after ... flag"
You supplied an 'f' keyletter to add the flag named, and
you also supplied a value for the flag. However, the named flag
cannot be assigned a value.
-14
"no default sid"
You are trying to add the 'd' flag (default SID) to the
SCCS file, but you did not supply an SID for it.
This flag must have an SID.
-15
"more than one file"
You are trying to create more than one SCCS file, and you supplied
the 'i' keyletter. You can only create one file when you supply
the 'i' keyletter.
-16
"r only allowed with i"
You specified the 'r' keyletter for an SCCS file without
also specifying the 'i' keyletter. The 'r' keyletter may not be
specified except with the 'i' keyletter.
-17
"t has no argument"
You were creating a new SCCS file, and you specified the
't' keyletter, but you did not supply the name of the text file
from which to take commentary.
-18
"d not allowed with n"
You are trying to delete flags from a non-existent but being-created
SCCS file. You can only do this to old files.
-19
"file ... exists"
You are trying to create the named SCCS file, but it already
exists.
-20
"file ... does not exist"
You are trying to modify the named file, but it
does not exist.
-21
"... illegal data on line ..."
The named line in the file you supplied for the 'i' or 't'
keyletter begins with the SCCS control character (ASCII 001).
It is illegal to input such data to SCCS.
-22
"floor not numeric"
The value you specified for the floor flag is not
a number. Check for typos.
-23
"floor out out of range"
The value you specified for the floor flag is either less than 1
or greater than 9999.
-24
"ceiling not numeric"
The value you specified for the ceiling flag is not
a number. Check for typos.
-25
"ceiling out out of range"
The value you specified for the ceiling flag is either less than 1
or greater than 9999.
-26
"directory named with `i' keyletter"
The name specified for the SCCS file name was a directory.
Only one SCCS file is allowed to be specified with the `-i' keyletter.
-27
"bad list format"
The format for the list of locked releases is syntactically incorrect.
The correct format for a list is:

		<list>  ::= <range> | <list>,<range>
		<range> ::= REL_NO | ``a''

where REL_NO is considered to be the first component in a
_SCCS __IDentification string (SID).
-28
"element in list out of range"
An element contained in the list for ``locking'' or ``unlocking''
releases is out of range.
That means its value is probably greater than 9999,
the maximum release number.
-29
directory `...' specified as `...' keyletter value
The value specified with the named keyletter argument is
a directory.  This is not allowed since the SCCS file created
would not be accessible by other SCCS commands.
-30
illegal use of `y' or `m' keyletter
The `y' and `m' keyletters for "admin" may only be used in
conjunction with the `i' or `n' keyletters, i.e. when creating a
new SCCS file.  Use "cdc" to change comments or MR numbers of an
existing file.
