First, if you know the value of the system error number (errno),
you can look up a description of it in INTRO(2).
If you don't know the error number, or you don't understand what's going on -
Try the following, in order:
1. Make sure the answer isn't in the documentation.
2. Try to write(1) to anyone logged in as "adm".
3. Contact your UNIX counsellor.
4. File an MR (see System Administrator for instructions).
