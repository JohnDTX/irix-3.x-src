	/* This Program checks for many of the errors
	 * which can be committed in PWB/MM input including some tbl & eqn.
	 *
	 * It is intended to be faster to save both user and processor
	 * time.
	 *
	 * Savings of 15:1 have been measured on files of 20,000 char
	 * X 1000 lines with only a few errors to print.
	 *
	 *
	 * It also avoids garbled output from mixing formatted results
	 * with error messages although there are other ways to do this.
	 *
	 * Another advantage is that it makes explicit statements about
	 * mistakes which cause output to be lost.
	 *
	 *
	 * The errors are those recognized from the relevant
	 * documents on the macros (mm 8.2) and Tbl and Eqn.
	 *
	 * In fact the Eqn checking code was lifted directly
	 * from the checkeq program.
	 *
	 * A couple of minor additional eqn checks are made in the
	 * Lex part of this program.
	 *
	 * The remainder of the Lex checks for nesting,
	 * missing, and out of sequence errors of other commonly
	 * used macros.
	 *
	 * There is no claim to completeness and the error messages
	 * are cast differently from those of PWB/MM.
	 *
	 * The need for this program may well diminish with the
	 * error diagnostics accompanying version 2.0.
	 *
