	Function to find the position, in str, of the first of the char-

	contains matched occurrences of any character in open and the corres-
	ponding character in clos.  Balanced strings may be nested.  The null
	at the end of str is considered to belong to end.  Unmatched members
	of open or clos result in an error return.
